	    <p>I earn my livelihood as an Internet programmer, and as such I
	    attempt to help people finding their ways about on the web by
	    implementing various kinds of search engines. I do this together
	    with friends and colleagues at <a
	    href="http://www.lub.lu.se/">Lund University Libraries</a> and
	    before that at <a href="http://www.lub.lu.se/netlab/">NetLab</a>
	    (see also info on <a
	    href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue32/netlab-conference/">NetLab's
	    birthday party</a> and a note on the <a
	    href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue32/netlab-history/">history of
	    NetLab</a>).</p>

	    <div class="level2" id="web_indexing">
	      <h2 class="level2">Web indexing</h2>

	      <p>Initially, I worked exclusively with robot based search
	      indexes.  Here at NetLab we implemented the <em>combine</em>
	      harvesting robot, which <a
	      href="http://www.lub.lu.se/combine/">you may get for
	      free</a>. The work is done as a part of the <a
	      href="http://www.desire.org/">Desire project</a>.</p>

	      <p>We used the Combine for a number of purposes. Among those
	      were to build the Nordic Web Index. <a
	      href="http://hem.bredband.net/sigfridlundberg/1996/nwi/nwi.pdf">We
	      released the NWI 1996</a>, about a month after Digital released
	      <a href="http://www.altavista.com">Alta Vista</a>. Thus we were
	      among the first search engines to support European character
	      sets (with nasty characters like å, ä, ø, ö and the
	      like). During its life time, NWI usually had a higher coverage
	      of the Nordic web than its commercial competition. The NWI was
	      also one of the very first web indexes that had extensive
	      support for <a href="http://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core
	      Metadata</a>. We gave a
	      <a href="http://www7.scu.edu.au/programme/fullpapers/1900/com1900.htm">
		presentation</a> on this work at the 7th Internation World
		wide web conference.</p>

		<p>For quite some time I used the Combine for a lot of
		different projects, such as the now defunct Safari research
		information service (again, I wrote a <a
		href="/SigfridLundberg/1998/safari/cris.pdf">presentation of
		the service</a>, but I'm sorry, it is in swedish).</p>

	    <div class="level2" id="preservation">

	      <h2 class="level2">Digital preservation and publication</h2>

	      <p>Now my interests has shifted from the rather specific
	      problems of indexing the web towards digital preservation,
	      digital publishing and the searching of tagged text in general,
	      and in particular SGML/XML documents. I do not feel that there
	      is any difference between making available historical and
	      current material (which would be preservation and publication,
	      respectively). The main difference is the tense. What we do
	      today (present tense) will in the future be a preservation
	      problem (future tense).</p>

	      <p>The best example of my work in this area is the <a
	      href="laurentius.html">S:t Laurentius</a> <a
	      href="http://laurentius.lub.lu.se/">digital manuscript
	      library</a>.</p>

	      <p>I have written a <a
	      href="http://laurentius.lub.lu.se/search/presentation/laurentius.pdf">
	      conceptual description of the search engine</a> we built for our
	      manuscript collection.</p>

	      <p>The most importan current project within this area is <a
	      href="/2004/arkiv_bibliotek/">Ediffah</a>, which aims at
	      implementing a search engine for EAD finding aids for archives
	      in Swedish library collections.</p>

		<h2 class="level2">Putting stuff on the Web</h2>

		<p>Today electronic publishing usually means publishing stuff
		on a web server. A better part of my time is spent on building
		infrastructure for creating facilities for just that,
		including cataloging of such stuff and delivering it to end
		users in a structured way. I've recently made two services for
		use within Lund university, <a
		href="http://theses.lub.lu.se/undergrad/">Xerxes</a> and <a
		href="http://theses.lub.lu.se/postgrad/">Scripta Academica
		Lundensis</a>, aimed for publishing and dissemination of
		undergraduate and postgraduate electronic theses and
		dissertations.

	      <div class="level2" id="printing_n_publishing">

		<h2 class="level2">Printing and publishing</h2>

		<p>One of my passions is electronic typesetting, and in
		particular of scientific texts -- with equations, graphs,
		references, footnotes, quotations and you name it. Since I
		left science, I've had little opportunity to exercise that
		passion. However with the current XML boom, it is possible for
		me to make use of this old knowledge, in a new context.</p>

		<p>For texts I write myself, I use <a
		href="http://www.tei-c.org/">the TEI XML dtd</a> which I may
		then transformed into other formats (e.g., HTML) using <a
		href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</a>. For printed
		output I translate it into troff source, which I format using
		with <a href="http://www.jclark.com/bio.htm">James Clark</a>'s
		<a href="http://groff.ffii.org">groff</a> package, a free
		re-engineered version of troff, the UNIX (TM) typesetting
		system. Throught the years, I have written a lot of XSLT
		scripts, *roff macros, dozens of perl scripts that work with
		*roff for various purposes:</p>

		<p>I have prepared a <a
		href="../Laurentius/laurentius.tar.gz">worked example</a> on
		how to format a TEI document for printing, using XSLT and
		groff. Provided that you have perl with XML::LibXSLT, a modern
		groff (version 1.18), TeX fonts, dvips and ps2pdf installed,
		you should be able to run this and get a laurentius.pdf from
		the laurentius.xml. Most of these things is available as
		standard on a decent Linux workstation.</p>

		<p>I once wrote a <a
		href="ROFF/gnuplot_gpic_driver.shar">gnuplot driver</a> for
		producing graphs using *roff. Supports gpic and pic (vanilla
		UNIX version). My original driver seems obsolete now, but the
		current pic gnuplot driver doesn't seem to work with 3D
		graphds.</p>

	      <p>I've had the pleasure to participate in most of <a
	      href="http://www.dublincore.org/">the DCMI workshops</a>. The

	      href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue9/caption/">Metadata
	      workshop</a> in Canberra March 1997 (I'm fattest one of the two
