<h1>Lund and S:t Laurentius Cathedral</h1> 

<p>The S:t Laurentius cathedral is the large church in the center of
the image. Some of the most precious items in our collections came the
the library at the cathedral.</p>

<p>This is the city I love. And I'm very happty to live in it. The
drawing is a late renaissance impression of it, though. The current
sky-line of the city is much more boring.</p>
