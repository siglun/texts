<h1>Curriculum Vitae for <a href="./">S. Lundberg</a></h1>
<h2>1. Scientific Career</h2>

<p>
Ph. D. 1985:Thesis <i>Five theoretical excursions into evolutionary
ecology,</i> Lund 1985.  Docent (approximately associate professor,
although untenured) 1995.</p>

<h2>1.1. Positions and research/development projects after graduation</h2>

<p>Postdoc (financed by Swedish Natural Sciences Research Council, NFR)
at Imperial College, London, in Parasite Epidemiology Research Group
visiting Prof. Roy Anderson, FRS.</p>

<p>Assistant professor (forskarassistent, NFR) 1 July 1987 to 1 July 1993.
Since 1 October 1993 working on the following projects</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>On the regulation of the flow of genetic from an artificial to a
natural ecosystem.</li>

<li>Evolutionary aspects on the epidemiology of childhood diseases.</li>

<li>Ecological and evolutionary Stability and dynamics of mutualistic
systems.</li>

<li>Pollinator foraging behaviour and the dynamics and evolution of pollinator--plant-systems.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the last area, I published work 1998.</p>

<p>Since October 1995 scientist at the Lund university library,
working on various development projects concerning Internet search and
information retrieval, metadata, design of our harvesting robot and
archiving of WWW documents.</p>

<h2>1.2. Teaching and supervision</h2>

<p>The first few years as a post-graduate student I had higher
teaching load than most students average (initially my position
required 50% teaching).  Later I have lectured mathematics for
post-graduate students in ecology.  My first post-graduate student,
Noél Holmgren, was awarded his Ph. D. 93.  In addition I have
regularly lectured on ecological modelling techniques and evolutionary
genetics to students of theoretical ecology.</p>

<h2>2. Computing and internetworking</h2>

<p>As a natural scientist I have no formal merits in neither computer
science, nor in software engineering.  My knowledge stems from two
sources: (i) Many years experience of scientific computing within
areas where shrink wrapped software is virtually absent.  (ii) Many
years experience of system administration (Unix ) within the Dept of
Theoretical Ecology.  (iii) Several years experience of
internetworking, initially at the Dept of Theoretical Ecology, and
later at Lund University Library's development depart NetLab.  In the
following I give <i>examples</i> of achievments within the area of
software engineering and internetworking.  (In doing that, I will
ignore the area, scientific computing, in which I have gained my
proficiency in computer programming.)</p>

<h2>2.1. Operating systems</h2>

<p>I have used computers intensely Through my entire career within
research and development.  During the first five years (1979-1984) I
wrote my applications on the university mainframe running the
operating system OS1100.  During that period I spent a significant
proprortion of my time punching cards.  Later on I aquired a personal
computer and used MS DOS (1985-1987).  Since 1989 I have been using
Unix excusively for all applications and as a Unix user I have been my
system administrator.  I have experience of System V (AIX, Linux and
Solaris) Berkley unix (Ultrix and SunOS).  I have been using Linux
since release 0.14, and are well versed in the pitfalls using this OS
I have been using Internet since 1988.</p>

<h2>2.2. Programming</h2>

<p>I'm programming in Perl, C, and Fortran. I can, if needed do work
in LISP, PROLOG, TCL, SQL (if that count as a programming language),
Javascript and MatLab.</p>

<h2>2.3. Scientific typesetting</h2>

<p>I have a sincere interest in the formatting of scientific
text. I've work TeX as well as troff for the purposes, and I'm able to
do advanced macro programming. In this context I'm also working with
SGML and XML, and able to use photo type-setting software in companion
with XML-parsers and XSLT, XML Style Sheet Language Transformations.</p>

<p>I am also interested in the photo typesetting of graphs and charts
and I am the author of the gnuplot pic driver, which makes it possible
to typeset graphs using groff and annotate those with mathematical
symbols. I have contributed the Linux vgalib driver for the popular
ghostscript postscript interpreter, which was widely used at the time
when few Linux PC ran X windows.</p>

<h2>2.4. Internetworking and information services</h2>

<p>I have experience of using and maintaining servers for most popular
TCP/IP protocols appearing in an Unix environment, including mail,
WAIS and Z39.50 databases, WWW and gopher.  In addition I have
experience of maintaing mailinglists, line printing using Berkeley
LPD, NFS etc.</p>

<p>I have extensive knowledge of CGI programming, a good example is my
``<a href="http://fisher.teorekol.lu.se/simulation_server/">Simulation
server</a>''. NB this service is now off-line. It is written Perl,
Octave, uses gnuplot scripting for plotting and various graphics
utilities for delivering images using CGI.  The server solves systems
of ordinary differential equations, presents the solution graphically,
and generates HTML pages with information on the solution.</p>

<p>At NetLab I have been engaged in producing the <a
href="http://www.lub.lu.se/combine/">Combine harvesting robot</a>,
which is a distributed package in which different functional
components interact through interprocess communication.</p>

<p>At NetLab, I've been involved in development projects like NWI,
Desire, Desire II, ETB, SAFARI and STUDERA.nu.</p>
