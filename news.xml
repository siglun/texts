      <p>I've spent much of the last fifteen years working on problems related
      to interoperability, portability and longevity of data, and in
      particular metadata in a librar context. During these years I've been
      working a lot with XML.</p>

      <p>Early on I evangelized about XML with the fervour of a taleban. I
      suppose that I contributed to the four or five years of XML hype that
      started at the turn of the century and culminated 2004 - 2005
      (cf. Figure 1, and Edd Dumbill's <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/11/03/deviant.html">How Do I Hate
      Thee?</a>). Since then I've become more moderate, but still embrace XML
      as the preferred tool for the modelling of data.</p>

	  <small>Figure 1. The number of web pages appearing per year
	  containing the phrase <strong><q>hate xml</q></strong>. There is a
	  steep increase in occurence a few year after the Applied XML
	  Developer's Conference 2004. After that it seems to level
	  off.</small>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <small>The data points represents hits pooled for two year periods
	  graphed against the first of january the second year in each
	  period.</small>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <small>Because of the way Google works, the date searches mostly
	  hits blog entries and other syndicated material, where publication
	  date and other metadata are known. The earliest occurence is from
	  2001.</small>

      <p>Once you have grasped a technology you cannot keep up strong
      emotions, at least not positive ones. You see both the shortcomings and
      the advantages. Possibly you can become more negative as time goes
      by. Or that is my personal experience. I think that our relations to our
      technologies is a bit like human relations. There is an early period
      when you fall in love. Then if you're lucky there is a long period of
      friendship and love of another deeper kind that may last much
      longer.</p>

      <p>Already year 2000 a friend of mine described his relation to XML as
      <q>angle bracket fatique</q>, which I suppose is to be understood as
      <q>I hate typing XML, since its syntax is just terrible</q>.</p>

	  <strong><q>hate xml</q></strong>. There are hardly any connection

	  wrote about it.</small>

      <h3><q>Developers hate XML</q></h3>

      <p>Year 2004, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">sellsbrothers.com</a> convened an
      <a href="http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Techniques/Programming-Guidance-from-the-Uumlbergeeks/">Applied
      XML Developer's Conference</a>. I cannot recollect that I heard of that
      conference at the time, but there was one contribution which got quite
      some attention around in the blogosphere. It was by Chris Anderson (AKA
      <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">SimpleGeek</a>) who gave the
      presentation <q>Developers Hate XML</q>. I haven't found the slides on
      the net. However, <a href="http://www.jeff-barr.com/?p=80">Jeff Barr</a>
      summarizes as follows</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Chrisâ€™s big beef with XML is that XML must be processed in
	isolation, using special purpose tools and languages such as XSLT. In
	order to use these special things, <strong>developers must become
	domain experts</strong></em> [my emphasis] <em>in a rich and complex
	space that is essentially unrelated to the application itself.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I think Chris (and Jeff) points out something important here. Many
      developers are interested in programming and computing, but not
      necessarily application areas. To parse and make something meaningful
      out of, say, bibliographical records or encoded text requires that you
      are actually interested in those areas. The same is true for fluid
      mechanics and natural language processing. Interest in partial
      differential equations and lingustics, respectively, will help.</p>

      <p>I cannot see any difference here between XML and SQL in this
      respect. Any tools for object-relational modeling is subject to the same
      problems. The developers that do the modelling has to become domain
      experts. This is fairly obvious for XML and less so for SQL. While few
      people form large scale standardization efforts for XML schemas, they
      hardly do so for RDBMS Schemas. </p>

      <p>What XML technologies provide that RDBMSs don't is an interoperable
      transfer syntax. Which I suppose is the reason why most XML in the world
      is stored in, well, RDBMSs.</p>

      <h3>On hatred</h3> 

      <p>I cannot recall that I've ever written somewhere that I hate someone
      or even something.  I feel that hatred is emotional and irrational. It
      may be a difference between languages and cultures, though; it can also
      be a question of semantic inflation.</p>

      <p>When we Scandinavians say that we hate something, we mean it.  I'm
      not sure that that's the case in the anglo-american sphere, and I'm not
      even certain that's the case for young Scandinavians.  However, when
      you're a middle-aged academic and intellectual, you may not think it's
      appropriate to hate. Or, at least, you may not think that it's
      appropriate to describe your dislikes and annoyances as hatred.</p>

      <p>I have tried, a lot, to find out what people think about technologies
      such as XML, SQL, noSQL etc. Here both love and hatred are used as code
      words. People hate (or love) XML the same way they love (or hate) bebop,
      pop or hip hop music. Not the way they love their children, wife or
      mother.</p>
