       <p>This is not really a scientific paper, or rather it does not look
       like one. Rather, it is a document written, maintained and used
       1993-1995 internally within the CSTR project (Computer Science
       Technical Reports).  The text has since influenced the development, and
       was finally published in a special issue on <a href="http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=1124646&amp;type=issue&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=85174388&amp;CFTOKEN=70566202">complex
       digital objects</a> of <em>International Journal on Digital
       Libraries</em>. I ensure you that you'll find more references to that
       issue here in the weeks to come.</p>

       <p>The importance of the CSTR project cannot be overestimated. In many
       ways it lead forward to initiatives such as DCMI and OAI, and indeed
       the establishment of digital libraries research as a discipline on its
       own right.</p>

       <p>Having written this, I have to confess that I've already lost the
       interest to discuss it further.</p>
