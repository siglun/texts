      <p>Three reflexions inspired by the three</p>

      <h3>I</h3>

      <p>Adobe has grown from being the owner of postscript and the electronic
      font foundry of the 1990's. It is still going strong on the traditional
      markets but have a lot of inpact on just about anything related to media
      consumption and production.</p>

      <p>Apple don't support flash. Apple don't support the *.epub copy
      protection promoted by Adobe.</p>

      <p><small>Fig. 1. The search interest for "tablet pc" in Google. It has
      been declining until very recently :-)</small></p>

      <h3>II</h3>

      <p>Amazon thinks that eBooks should be cheap, say $9.99. Just as Apple
      thinks that 99 cent is OK for a track. Publishers in general and
      MacMillan in particular doesn't like that and suggests $14.99.</p>

      <p>Apple likes that.</p> 

      <p>Torrent users doesn't like that.</p> 

      <h3>III</h3>

      <p>I don't think that iPad will have any effect on eBook prices in the
      long run. However, the tablet PC will, finally, gain in popularity. And
      so will eBooks.</p>

      <p>The eBooks will make 40 year old books a commercial asset, which will further
      decrease the libraries market share.</p>
