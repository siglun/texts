      <p>I have just recently bought a new digital camera, one of the new
      Electronic Viewfinder Interchangable Lens (EVIL) ones. Actually one that
      embodies all the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/five-reasons-you-should-ditch-your-dslr/">5
      Reasons to Ditch Your Digital SLR</a>. It is an Olympus PEN E-P 2, 
      a second generation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system">Micro Four
      Thirds</a> camera.</p>

      <h3>How I ditched my SLR</h3>

      <p>One could say that I've ditched my SLR, but that I did very long
      ago.</p>

      <p>I've been interested in photography since I was a teenager. My father
      was a printer and he had a workshop where I worked during summer
      holidays. When I was thirteen or fourteen I used my savings together
      with some extra support from my parents to by a Nikon F single-lens
      reflex camera. This must have been 1969-70. I still keep this treasure,
      but the configuration has improved. The original 50 mm F1.4 lens was
      replaced with a 35mm wide angle and a 135m tele lens. My Nikon stuff are
      items number 4-10 in Figure 1.</p>

      <p>During the mid eighties I lost my interest in photography, but it was
      (kind of) revitalized when our two children were born 1988-89. That lead
      to the acquisition of an easy to use 35mm compact camera, which could be
      carried a pocket and swiftly pulled out to document the various
      milestones in the kids development.</p>

      <p>More recently my wife and myself decided, I'd say less than five
      years ago, that the time was ripe to buy a digital camera. A bit later
      still we acquired smarter phones. The digital camera was actually a
      really good one. I used it to take the snap shot in Figure 1. The phone
      caused a new development I hadn't expected.</p>

	<p>

	  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Glumsl%C3%B6v,+Sweden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=FUioVQMdCGLDAA&amp;split=0&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Glumsl%C3%B6v,+Landskrona,+Sk%C3%A5ne,+Sweden&amp;ll=55.929202,12.790146&amp;spn=0.019907,0.055189&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">places
	  along the Strait of Øresund</a>. I think myself that this is a nice
	  picture taken with my <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/n900/">mobile
	  phone</a>. It is nice from almost all perspective except the
	  technical ones. I blame on the digital zoom, but excuses cannot
	  change the fact that the poor image quality masks all the other
	  qualities of the image.</small>
	</p>

      <h3>How I ditched my camera phone</h3>

      <p>Once I has a serious interest in photography. I lost that. I have
      still all darkroom equipment in a few cardboard boxes in the
      basement.</p>

      <p>The phone changed everything. I continuously carried around (what I
      used to regard as a) decent camera. All the images I've recently <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/subjects/images/">put on this site</a>
      are taken with my phone. I started to think of image composition rules
      again.</p>
      
      <p>Now, web images are one thing. High resolution things you can print
      large copies to put on your wall is something else. Now, I copied some
      images to an USB stick had the local photo store enlarge them to
      20x30cm. Figure 2 was one of the images. When I did this, I hadn't
      looked at the image in any other way than in the phone's viewer.</p>

      <div style="float:left;width:364px;margin-right:0.5em;margin-left:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/20100819_001_smaller.jpg">

	  f=35mm using the Voigtländer adapter. See Figure 1 for the details
	  on the various items.</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>I just cannot tell how disappointed I was with the result. This,
      however, coincided with me something else. I brought all my
      photographical chemicals to the deposit for environmentally hazardous
      chemicals.</p>

      <h3>Micro four thirds</h3>

      <p>I felt that I somehow had lost a way to express myself. I became
      obsessed with the thought of a really good camera which I could carry
      around without any effort. I found the Olympus PEN in the local Photo
      Store. It is a real beauty, with the right feeling. I suppose it is all
      plastic, but it doesn't feel like it.</p>

      <p>The decisive point was all the communities where people mentioned all
      the wonderful lenses they are able to put on these cameras. That is a
      virtue of standardization.</p>

      <div style="float:right;width:364px;margin-right:0.5em;margin-left:0.5em;">

	  <small>Figure 4. Now I have again controll. These two details are my
	  Nikon F body photographed with the configuration you see in Figure
	  2. In (a) I have at least tried to focus on <q>Nikon</q>, whereas in
	  (b) the focus is on <q>3.5</q> on the 135mm lens.</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>However, there are not that many different kinds of lenses available,
      but there are a <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/adp_micro_43.htm">large number of
      adapters</a>. Leica, Nikon and all other kinds of lenses are now used
      successfully and there are people whose interest in photography seems to
      boil down to find obscure lenses to fit on their micro 4/3 shooters. For
      instance, there are a lot of <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/digitalcameras/0,39001469,62061468,00.htm">C-mount</a>
      video and cinematic lenses available. One example is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coyanis/4337508202/">P. Angenieux
      25mm/f0.95</a> from the early sixties and originally a professional cine
      lens.</p>

      <p>Believe me, eBay has got an entirely new segment of lens
      collectors.</p>

      <h3>My NIKKOR lenses</h3>

      <p>I suppose that you've already realized that when you put a vintage
      SLR lens on a modern digital camera there are things you loose. You use
      them with fixed aperture and the camera choose the exposure. This is
      better than what I'm used to. I don't need to bring use my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anssipuisto/4059736964/">Gossen
      Variosix light meter</a>. Also, you have to focus manually.</p>

      <p>The interesting effect of the m4/3 architecture is that my NIKKOR-O
      35mm, which used to be my wide angle lens back in the seventies, is now
      a short telephoto lens. It is the equivalent of a 70mm lens and ideal
      for landscapes and portraits.</p>

      <p>In addition, its maximum aperture 2.0 is
      much better than what you get today in the kit zoom lens of an ordinary
      DSLR. With the wide aperture that lens gives me the possibilty to focus
      on a just a part of an image leave an unsharp back- or forground (Figure
      4).</p>

      <div style="float:left;width:364px;margin-right:0.5em;margin-left:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/P8230492.JPG">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/P8230492_smaller.JPG" width="364px" alt="A fountain in Central Park, Lund, Sweden"/>

	</a>
	<p><small>Figure 5. A fountain in Central Park, Lund, Sweden. An early
	morning, taken with the Olympus PEN kit zoom Zuiko Digital 14-42mm
	F3.5-5.6, which is really nice lens. The camera as it is delivered is
	really good, even without vintage equipment.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>My NIKKOR-Q 135mm 1:3.5 is also capable collecting more light than
      most modern zoom lenses. When I bought it, this was regarded as a poor
      lens in this respect. On the other hand, I wouldn't even dream of a zoom
      at the time. The 135mm lens is more difficult to use than the 35mm
      one. It is heavier, naturally, than the other lenses and it is not that
      easy to focus. To increase the success rate, I'm considering to bring my
      tripod, but then the equipment isn't that portable anymore.</p>

      <h3>The Olympus lens</h3>

      <p>I don't have more than the original Zuiko Digital kit lens (See
      Figure 5). It is a very nice and light lense and with it, the e-p2 is
      almost as light as any compact camera.</p>
