      <p>The most frequently retrieved document from this site is my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SigfridLundbergsStuff?format=xml">syndication
      feed</a>. I can tell that from the otherwise lousy statistics provided
      by my ISP. I also use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google
      Analytics</a>, and the crude statistics from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedBurner">FeedBurner</a>. Analytics
      doesn't tell me anything about the use of the feed, since I cannot embed
      javascript in a feed. Only Googlebot (I use it as a Google Sitemap) and
      Feedburner accesses the feed directly,. The rest of you get the feed via
      Feedburner.</p>

      <p>Feedburner keeps a cache, and refreshes that every 30 minutes. The
      feed is retrieved around 250 times a week, and I would have expected
      2*24*7=336 hits on the feed. Note that 250 includes Googlebot. Since
      I've no direct access to the Apache log files I cannot tell how the file
      is retrieved. If I was Google I would add an
      <kbd>If-Modified-Since</kbd> header to my GET request and looked for a
      Status 304 (not modified) in the response. Then I could get away with a
      much lower access frequency and gain throughput. This would explain the
      slightly lower access rate than expected.</p>

      <p>My estimate is that about five to ten persons visits my site daily
      and that two or three of them read something. Furthermore, between ten
      and fifteen readers follows me using the feed. In particular the use
      stats for the feed is hard to evaluate.</p>

      <h3>Headless Layout &amp; Absolute Links</h3>

      <p>All the entries on this site are written directly in Atom using nxml
      mode for Emacs. The <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/colophon/">site is
      generated</a> from this source using a number of different scripts, the
      bulk of it written in XSLT. The source file for this entry is <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/syndication/syndication.atom">here</a>.
      There are two things you have to think about when you write and design
      your content for syndication:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Your content will be rendered in sites which isn't yours: You
	cannot use relative URIs, and a lot of your javascript won't
	work.</li>

	<li>You have to manage without the
	<kbd>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</kbd> and everything you normally
	would put there which implies that you can not use
	<kbd>&lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;</kbd> elements and that you are
	unable to define CSS classes.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The problem with javascript manifests itself differently. <a href="http://grazr.com">grazr.com</a> has a nice category browser, which
      can be used on some of <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/">KB's
      data</a>. It seases to work at least when stuff is syndicated on Google
      Hompepage.</p>

	<p><small>Fig. 1. My <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/stanford/">previous
	entry</a> as it appears on my iGoogle Homepage. Note that all the
	captions appear next to the first image, not as they should adjacent
	to the corresponding one. This is Google chrome but it looks the same
	in Firefox.</small></p>
      </div>


      <p>When I write these entries I preview them using the server I run on
      my laptop. Making the links absolute is the last thing I do before
      publishing to the web. I forget this now and then, and I won't see that
      before it has been through feedburner and reached google and
      bloglines. The rebuild-run-debug cycle is long for syndicated
      content.</p>

      <p>There migh be problems with the feed readers HTML support. I'm
      currently only the online ones, iGoogle and Bloglines, so the html
      shouldn't theoretically not be a problem on them, but still there
      is.</p>

      <p>One is that (for instance) Google defines stuff in its CSS which
      changes the behaviour of tags in a way such that my content does not
      look as intended. The <kbd>&lt;kbd&gt;...&lt;kbd&gt;</kbd> (keyboard)
      didn't work the last time I checked. The other problem is that (for
      instance) Google actually edits my markup. It seems that in my previous
      entry, the one about stanford, Google stripped the <kbd>&lt;br
      clear="all"/&gt;</kbd> elements from its attribute
      (<kbd>clear="all"</kbd>) and that CSS redefines the break tag in some
      way or another (see Fig. 1).</p>

      <h3>An experiment</h3>

      <p>Please bear with me. Below you find the content from my previous
      entry. In this version I'm employing some other methods for achieving a
      break. I indicate in the text which method I use.</p>

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">

	</a>
      </div>

      <p>A lovely garden somewhere between our hotel and the Meyer Library at
      Stanford University. Break is the original <kbd>&lt;br
      clear="all"/&gt;</kbd>. Predicted behaviour: No break will be
      generated in Google.</p>

      <br clear="all"/>

      <div style="float:right;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/stanford/20100322318.jpg" title="Rodin at Stanford">

      </div>

      <p>Gustave Rodin at Stanford University. You may want to compare this
      with <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/thinking/">the
      Rodin in Copenhagen.</a> Break is using CSS <kbd>&lt;br
      style="clear:both;"/&gt;</kbd> Predicted behaviour: Will not generate a
      break if Google strips all attributes on &lt;br/&gt; and generate one if
      it just strips clear</p>

      <br style="clear:both;"/>

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/stanford/20100322320.jpg" title="Graffiti?">

	</a>
      </div>

      <p>A nice graffiti, or is it al fresco? And what is the difference?
      Break is using an empty <kbd>&lt;div
      style="clear:both;"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</kbd>. Predicted behaviour: Will
      generate a break in Google.</p>
