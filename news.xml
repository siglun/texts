      <p><em><a href="#barthes">Camera Lucida</a></em> is Roland Barthes'
      thoughts about photographs and our memories. In particular the
      photographs he had of his mother after her death 1977. The book was
      published 1980.</p>

      <p>It is just 120 pages, a short book. In chapter 47 (out of 48 brief
      texts) he concludes:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>The <em>noeme</em> [i.e., the essence] of photography is simple,
	banal; no depth: ‘That has been.’ I know our critics: What,
	a whole book (even a short one) to discover something I knew at first
	glance?</q>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Barthes is trying to pinpoint the essence of the photograph, not
      necessarily the essence of photography. He arrives at the conclusion that a
      photograph is basically an indication that its subject has existed and
      the photographer was there to see it. All those people who take
      photographs everywhere basically tells everyone that they've been there
      and they have seen <em>it</em> whatever that was.</p>

      <p>I think that he is basically correct. Most photographs taken are
      snaps, and the popularity of Instagram and Snapchat are further proof of
      that. In the very last chapter he says something really suprising:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>Photography can in fact be an art: when there is no longer any
	madness in it, when its <em>noeme</em> is forgotten and when
	consequently its essence no longer acts on me</q>
      </blockquote>

	<p><small>Lewis Payne, portrait by Alexander Gardner from 1865. Roland
	Barthes' caption under this photographe reads: <em><q>He is dead, and
	he is going to die.</q></em> We look into the eyes of a young handsome
	man, awaiting his execution. It is defiant gaze though, filled of
	arrogance he is looking over your right shoulder.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>Basically, Roland Barthes seem to say that art photography is
      boring. That is a very sweeping conclusion, and an extremely subjective
      one. The artsy photo is pure <em>studium</em>, not
      <em>punctum</em>. The former means that the cognitive effect of an image
      is that one looks at itand perhaps learns something from it, whereas the
      <em>punctum</em> implies an area which pricks, or triggers a minor shock or
      surprise.</p>

      <p>Arthur Koestler worked on a unified theory of human creativity. One
      of his points is somehow related to Barthes' dichotomy. Koestler
      proposes that human creativity has three domains named after their
      cognitive effects, <strong>haha</strong>, <strong>aha</strong> and
      <strong>ah</strong>. They correspond to creativity within humour,
      discovery and the arts, respectively. Put another way: These are the
      three ways anything can be awesome. There are hardly any other ways, if
      you ask me.</p>

      <p>Following Barthes' ways of reasoning, I'd say that it is obvious that
      <em>punctum</em> could contain elements of <strong>haha</strong> or
      <strong>aha</strong> or both. Just by the sound of it, I feel that an
      <strong>ah</strong> is more related to the sublime; the great or the
      beautiful. Something Barthes would regard, at its best, as a good
      <em>studium</em>. I doubt that Barthes would voluntarily place a
      <em>punctum</em> into a one of Alfred Stieglitz' nudes of Georgia
      O'Keeffe or any Ansel Adams' landscapes.</p>

	  <img src="/entries/2014/11/cameralucida/2013-03-24_18.02.32.jpg" width="100%" alt="My mother teaches me riding my bike"/>
	</a>
	<p><small>I believe my mother taught me to ride my bike 1962. I was
	six years old then. At the time I had grey trousers and suspenders, and I had some
	hair that stood on end and defied any attempt to tame it with a
	comb. The bicycle was green, and I loved it in spite of the fact that
	it was a little bit too high. To me the <em>punctum</em> is the
	perfect shadow.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p style="clear:left;">Barthes concludes, in chapter 23:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>Last thing about the <em>punctum</em>: whether or not it is
	triggered, it is an addition: it is what I add to the photograph and
	<em>what is nonetheless already there.</em></q>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Hence the photographer must do something interesting, or there won't
      be any <em>punctum</em>, but it is the viewer that put it into place in
      the image. The <em>punctum</em> is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>

      <p>There are a quite a few interesting image examples in Barthes' book,
      like the portraits by Richard Avedon of William Casby (<a href="http://bit.ly/1vPYIo8">Born a slave</a> from 1963) and by
      Alexander Gardner of Lewis Powell from 1865. Apart from the fact both
      are very high quality portraits, there is an interesting connection
      between them. Powell was one of four who were hanged for participation
      in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln after the end of the civil war
      that gave the freedom to Casby.</p>

      <p>You know that Powell is dead, and you know that he knew that he was
      going to die, perhaps that same day the photo was taken. This fact alone
      makes me place a <em>punctum</em> on his hands with the handcuffs. It is
      me that place it, but it was Gardner who made it possible.</p>

	<p><small>A mother's hands. The hands that held me when I learned to
	ride my bike. My mother died two years ago, at 99 years of age. I came
	an hour and a half too late, and could only say farewell after she had
	gone.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>Perhaps one third of <em>Camera Lucida</em> is about Roland Barthes mother,
      and his quest for a photo that could carry his memories of her. He
      should recognize her <q>essential identity, the genious of the beloved
      face.</q></p>

      <p>He goes into some detail on how he searched for a nice photo of that
      face. At last he found one, a photo of her as a five year old child
      where she is standing together with her brother on a wooden bridge in a
      conservatry, a winter garden. He then writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>I had understood that henceforth I must interrogate the evidence of
	Photography, not from the viewpoint of pleasure, but in relation to
	what we romantically call life and death.</q>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Then he adds that just couldn't reproduce the winter garden photo. It
      was too personal, and noone else would be able to place a punctum in
      it. Camera Lucida was Barthes last book. He died himself a few weeks
      after its publication (<a href="#dillon">Dillon, 2011</a>) .</p>

      <p>For me it was impossible to read it without thinking about mother, my
      own mother.</p>

      <p><q>A photograph should be more interesting than the subject and
      transcend its obviousness.</q> wrote Jeffrey Ladd.</p>
