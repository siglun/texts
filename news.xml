       <p>The rangefinder camera <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_CL">Leica CL</a> (also known
       as Leica Minolta CL) appeared 1973 as a joint venture between Leitz and
       Minolta. The collaboration did not last long, and the next version of
       this product was called Minolta CLE. without carrying a "Leica" or a
       Leitz logo.</p>

       <blockquote>
	 <em>
	   The Minolta CLE was introduced 1980. Yet, father Leitz makes haste
	   very slowly.  Until the introduction of the Leica M7 in 2001, the
	   CLE remained for 21 years the most technologically advanced Leica M
	   mount camera ever produced.  Not bad, for a Minolta.  Most CLE
	   owners consider it one of the best cameras they have ever owned.

       <p>The M Rokkor lenses were produced by Minolta for this excellent camera.
       I've recently aquired one of them, the 40mm f2.0, for use with my
       Olympus E-P2. On 35mm film leica M mount camera that lens is a standard
       (or <q>normal</q>) lens, albeit a bit more shorter than normal. On my micro
       four thirds camera it becomes a short telephoto lens, with a focal length
       suitable for portrait and landscape photography</p>

       <p>I'm not going to review the lens. Instead I'll refer to the
       following rather personal statement, again from Stephen Gandy:</p>

       <blockquote>
	 <em>The 40/2 lenses for the CL or CLE are among the sharpest lenses I
	 have ever used.</em> 
	 <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/cle.htm#Minolta%20CL%20and%20CLE%20Lenses">Stephen
	 Gandy, CameraQuest</a>
       </blockquote>

       <p>There are a lot of useful and interesting information to gather
       about rangefinder technologies; Stephen Gandy has a lot less info left
       to gather tnan most of us.</p>

       <p>I love this lens. Here <a href="http://www.flickriver.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/tags/mrokkor40mmf2/">you
       can see some photos</a> taken with it in Flickriver.</p>
