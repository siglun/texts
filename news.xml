      <p>This is my personal story of <em>'my'</em> part of the digitization
      workflow of The Royal Library. There are a lot of people working on
      this, and I'm only involved in the metadata processing &amp;
      dissemination part. And within this area there are several persons
      working; I'm not even the project leader.</p>

      <p>This entry is the second part of something that undoubtedly will
      become a series, because there are so much to consider in a beast like
      this.</p>

      <p>What I'm not going to talk about today is the image processing,
      because when we started this that part of the system was a boundary
      condition; it was there already. What we're up to is the processing of
      metadata, and the dissemination of them on the Worldwide Web.</p>
