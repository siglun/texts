      <p>November 2014 I started to write this text after having seen
      the exhibition <em>Between realities</em> at Dunkers. For
      various reasons I never completed it. Then came, spring 2017, I felt
      that I had to polish it a little, and publish it. It was my
      reading of Charlotte Cotton's <em>The Photograph as Contemporary
      Art,</em> a text I have difficulties to really appreciate, which
      triggered me to continue. It never happened, though.</p>

      <p>19 August 2014 marked the 175th anniversary of the art of
      photography. At least if we see the release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#Invention">Daguerre's
      patent</a> as the starting point of photography. Of those 175
      years, about 50 were good years for photojournalism. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalism#Golden_age">Its
      Golden Age started in the 1930s</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>The 'Golden Age of Photojournalism' is often considered to be roughly
	the 1930s through the 1950s. It was made possible by the
	development of the commercial 35mm Leica camera in 1925, and the first
	flash bulbs between 1927 and 1930 that allowed the journalist true
	flexibility in taking pictures.</p>
      </blockquote>


      
      <p>The glossy magazines continued another 20 years, though. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalism#Decline">But
      then</a>:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>The Golden Age of Photojournalism ended in the 1970s when many
	photo-magazines ceased publication. They found that they could not
	compete with other media for advertising revenue to sustain their
	large circulations and high costs.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Those other media were in many parts of the commercial
      television. Interestingly, now thirty years after the demise of the
      photo-magazines we see how the daily newspapers are losing advertising
      revenue since advertising is now moving to the Internet.</p>

      <p>It is also interesting to note that the genre started because of one
      technical innovation, and that it in its current form started to decline
      because of two other changed the viability business models of the press:
      television and the Internet.</p>

      <h3>The Photograph as Contemporary Art</h3>

      <p>Be that as it may, but the curators has recently been even
      more inclined to summarize their stories of Swedish photography
      in a number of retrospective exhibitions here in Sweden. There
      have also been group exhibitions following some threads from the
      past into the present. Less than half a year ago there was one
      opening at Moderna Malmö which has now moved the Stockholm head
      office, entitled <em>A WAY OF LIFE: Swedish photography from
      Christer Strömholm until Today</em>.</p>
      
      <p>The whole idea of this uncompleted entry is to correlate the
      demise of the glossy magazine with rise of photography as an art
      form, and how the prices of photography follows the ones in art
      into the hypothetical bubbles of the western economies.</p>

      <p>As usual the reality isn't as easy to grasp as you believe
      when you start formulating the hypotheses.</p>

      <h3>Addendum</h3>
      
      <p>A lot of things distracted me: Someone didn't want to share
      their data, and I got bought a new computer going from SUSE to
      Ubuntu forced me to migrate my environment, and when that was
      done there was no energy left for what is importan: Writing and
      making photographs. My attention was drawn in other directions,
      the most important one was the social media <a href="https://twitter.com/sigfridlundberg">notably twitter</a>
      which didn't require a whole computer and permitted me to sit
      and participate in the global exchange of fast food like content.</p>
