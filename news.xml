      <p>19 August 2014 marked the 175th anniversary of the art of
      photography. At least if we see the release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#Invention">Daguerre's
      patent</a></p>

      <p>Of those 175 years, about 50 were good years for photojournalism. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalism#Golden_age">Its
      Golden Age started in the 1930s</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>The 'Golden Age of Photojournalism' is often considered to be roughly
	the 1930s through the 1950s. It was made possible by the
	development of the commercial 35mm Leica camera in 1925, and the first
	flash bulbs between 1927 and 1930 that allowed the journalist true
	flexibility in taking pictures.</q>

	  Impressionism and modern (solid curve), (2) post worldwar 2 and

      <p>The glossy magazine continued another 20 years, though. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalism#Decline">But
      then</a>:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<q>The Golden Age of Photojournalism ended in the 1970s when many
	photo-magazines ceased publication. They found that they could not
	compete with other media for advertising revenue to sustain their
	large circulations and high costs.</q>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Those other media were in many parts of the commercial
      television. Interestingly, now thirty years after the demise of the
      photo-magazines we see how the daily newspapers are losing advertising
      revenue since advertising is now moving to the Internet.</p>

      <p>It is also interesting to note that the genre started because of one
      technical innovation, and that it in its current form started to decline
      because of two other changed the viability business models of the press:
      television and the Internet.</p>

      <p>Be that as it may, but the curators has recently been even more
      inclined to summarize their stories of Swedish photography in a number
      of retrospective exhibitions here in Sweden. There have also been group
      exhibitions following some threads from the past into the present. Less
      than half a year ago there was one opening at Moderna Malmö which has
      now moved the Stockholm head office, entitled <em>A WAY OF LIFE: Swedish
      photography from Christer Strömholm until Today</em>.</p>
