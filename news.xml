      <p>Waiting is not for everyone. I'm good at it, though. Brilliant, if I
      may say so myself. I've practiced. I'm particularly good at waiting
      for public transports. Such as waiting for trains. Or buses.</p>

      <p><q style="font-style:italic;">Patience</q>, states <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q2cJAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22art%20of%20waiting%22&amp;pg=PA119&amp;ci=134%2C1267%2C380%2C131&amp;source=bookclip">The
      Mirror</a> (Saturday 19, 1825), <q style="font-style:italic;">is the art
      of waiting.</q> That's true, for sure. But then the editor continues: <q style="font-style:italic;">Time passes quickly with him who hopes for
      days and lives for the morrow. Hope has such efficacy that it can lead
      us to the end of life through an agreeable path and even beyond life
      itself.</q> Interesting concept. The hopeful ones are those who believe
      that the bus will come and pick them up before they die. Or least such
      that they arrive home before dinner.</p>

      <p>I think that the The Mirror is wrong. Patience comes from the
      erroneous conviction that time spent waiting is an investment or an
      asset of some kind. The really patient person is the one who after
      waiting for (say) a quarter of an hour, dismisses the option to take a
      cab or walk, because he feels that he will then somehow loose the time
      he'd investmented in waiting. You've heard it, haven't you: <q>Let's
      wait five minutes more.</q></p>

      <p>Mind you, it's even worse than that, since it takes just twenty
      minutes to walk.</p>
