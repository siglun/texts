      <p>This is a portrait of a lens I've kept since I was a teenager. You
      can see it in <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/#nikkorO">an
      earlier entry</a>. There are quite a few web sites from Nikon F
      aficionados, such as Richard de Stoutz' <a href="http://www.destoutz.ch/nikon-f.html">Nikon F Collection &amp;
      Typology</a> who owns an almost <a href="http://www.destoutz.ch/lenses_wideangle_35mm_f2.html">complete
      series of the lens</a> and experienced professional users such as <a href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_surv.html">Bjørn
      Rørslett</a>. who owns <q>some 100 lenses</q> and give ratings a lot of
      them, including Nikon F <a href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_wide.html">wide angle
      ones</a>. This particular lens gets rating 5 for for traditional use
      with film and 4 otherwise. 5 is the highest rating and means:</p>

	<p>
	  <small>I took this photo of Angel's trumpet, <em>Brugmansia
	  suaveolens</em>, in the garden of Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. This plant
	  is as beautyful as it is extremely poisonous.</small>

      <blockquote>
	<p><em>Excellent. Use such lenses as often as possible and let other
	people wonder about the quality you can achieve with them.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      

      <p>The rating 4 means <q>Very good, quality results can be
      expected. Such lenses can safely be applied to professional
      photography.</q> I leave it to Bjørn, Richard and others to achieve the
      quality people will wonder about. A lens is an artist's tool, and the
      quality of the result depends on his or her skills.</p>

      <p>Be that as it may; a survey on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
      shows that you can get one of these for between $20 and $100, depending
      on whether the previous owners have used it <q>as often as possible</q>
      or not. If you're lucky and get it from someone who didn't understand
      just how good this lens is, then it is a bargain. Promise.</p>

      <p>Initially, I found it extremely hard to focus this lens. The first
      time I felt that I got almost right was when I took the photo the
      Angel's trumpet. The lens has a minum distance of less than 30cm so you
      can use it for macro photography. And as you can see, it has a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> with the aperture
      wide open.</p>

	</a>
	<p>
	  <small>Taken hand-held on my way home from the Old Bull. The lens is
	  wide open and it is night and the first winter mix is falling.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>The lens is fast, if not ultra-fast. I mean it isn't <a href="http://www.adorama.com/LC50095MN.html">Noctilux 50mm f0.95 at
      $10,000</a>, Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f1.1 or even any of all the f1.4
      around.</p>

      <p>The speed of the lens makes the depth of field quite small, and that
      does actually make it easier to focus. Just focus wide open¸ and then
      lessen aperture to something where your target is sharp. Then you get
      nice images for around $50.</p>
