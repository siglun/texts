      <p>I have had this site since 1995, but the oldest parts are in fact
      from 1994, which makes twenty years of personal presence on the web. I have
      thought about this for a while. For example, should I keep the site
      or just through it away and save a couple of hundred SEK per month?</p>

      <p>I've discussed <a href="/entries/2009/06/why/">why</a> before. After
      that, I decide to keep it several times a year. Whenever I pay the bill
      to my service provider.</p>

      <p>At times I just don't care about the site. I'm up to something
      else. If people have problem with my material not being up-to-date,
      that's their problem.  I don't care</p>

      <p>Although I only periodically care for the stuff I keep here, I've
      thought about if I</p>

      <ol style="margin:+0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
	<li>should continue with my current hosting and my own (home
	brewed) software.</li>
	<li>should stick to English as its main language, or
	return to my mother tongue Swedish?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>However, now I feel that there are things that is more easy to
      discuss in my native language, and many of my readers should find my
      material more accessible. After all, Swedes are the largest single
      nationality visiting my site. However the total number of readers from
      the rest of the world exceeds my Swedish readership (Figure 1).</p>

      <p>In short, expect more material in Swedish, but I will continue write
      in English whenever I expect that it is worthwhile.</p>

      <p>This means that you shouldn't really expect any significant changes
      here..., and don't ask me why I use several hundred words for telling
      you why I won't make any substantial change.</p>
