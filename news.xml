      <p>I have previously discussed the impact of the <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/ibooook/">tablet
      computer</a> and described how I've <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/n900/">acqired one
      myself</a>. Here I give some further pointers on the subject.</p>

      <p>Wired Magazine dedicated the cover and quite a few of its April issue
      to the appearance of the iPad. Here's two quotes:</p>

      <blockquote><em>[The iPad] will remake both book publishing and
      Hollywood, because it creates a transmedia that conflates books and
      video. You get TV you read, books you watch, movies you touch.</em>
      (<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays#kelly">Kevin
      Kelly</a>)</blockquote>

      <p>and</p>

      <blockquote><em>For decades, futurists have dreamed of the “universal
      book”: a handheld reading device that would give you instant access to
      every book in the Library of Congress. In the tablet era, it’s no longer
      technology holding us back from realizing that vision; it’s the
      copyright holders.</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays#johnson">Steven
      Johnson, 2010</a></blockquote>


      <p>I found this snippet on the effect of tablets on higher education:</p>

      <blockquote><em>Personally, I think that the current version of the iPad
      is the ultimate personal entertainment device, but one that has been
      designed for an ulterior purpose.  I believe the iPad is destined to
      become the first device/platform to make significant headway in the
      education space — particularly in higher education.</em> (<a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/2010/05/05/ipad-digital-learning/">Evan
      Schnittman </a>).</blockquote>

      <p>I can really recommend Evan Schnittman's blog <a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/">Black Plastic
      Glasses</a>.</p>
