	<p>This project will study methods for identification, indexing,
	search and retrieval of arbitrary parts or segments of structured
	information objects.</p>

	<p>The ability to address arbitrary points in texts, images or videos
	is a basic requirement for using the resources in a scholarly context,
	but also for annotation and <a

	cataloging. Finally, without it, it is more or less impossible to

	<h1>1. The problem identified</h1>

	<p>The library does many things; one of them is to act as a broker for
	information (Figure 1). I.e., it connects various environments for information
	production with environments of information consumption. Most
	consumption environments are user interfaces for services provided by
	the library, but some such as RSS feeds, are for end users -- or
	possibly in his or her feed reader.</p>

	    find digitized material. Users should be able to find data about
	    this material in general search engines, various union catalogs
	    and all these data should be syndicated to other services, such as
	    flickr or facebook.</p>

	<p>The challenge is to be able to produce functional data for each
	medium, that will satisfy special requirements in specialized
	consumption environments that will be possible to reuse in other
	similar environments but also possible to mirror in a integrated
	library catalog as well as in one of possibly many union catalogs.</p>

	<p>The problem I want to address is how to satisfy the user's need for
	information in production and consumption environments that are
	traditionally satisfying users needs for Document Like Objects (DLO's)
	such as books or articles. So what about the situation where the
	required information is</p>

	<h1>2. Standards and technologies</h1>

	<div>

	  <h2>2.1 Modeling structure</h2>

	  <p>In the area of mark-up languages, <a
	  href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/publications/DSDTD/go01.html#contmdl-gdef">a
	  content model</a> is <q
	  cite="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/publications/DSDTD/go01.html#contmdl-gdef">the
	  rules for the configuration of element and/or data content allowable
	  in instances of an element type</q>. I.e., a content model is a
	  range of objects that may be contained inside a container
	  object. This means that each element has its own content model.  A
	  related usage of the term content model emanates from the partly
	  overlapping communities around the <a
	  href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">Metadata Encoding and
	  Transmission Standard</a> (METS) and <a
	  href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/documentation/3.0b1/userdocs/digitalobjects/objectModel.html">Fedora
	  Commons</a>. See the nice overview of of Fedora content models
	  provided by, <a
	  href="https://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/display/INF/Fedora+Content+Models">Indiana
	  Digital Library</a> and the set of type attribute values used within
	  the <a
	  href="http://www.nla.gov.au/australianmetsprofile/documents/divTYPEvocabulary.pdf">Australian
	  METS Profile</a>. In this text, I will use the term <em>content
	  structure</em> rather than <em>content model</em>, since I need to
	  be able to discuss the content model of an element as well as the
	  internal structure of physical as well as digital information
	  objects.</p>

	</div>

	<div>

	  <h2>2.2. Modeling text</h2>

	  <p>An XML content model is the set of content objects that are valid
	  inside a given element. A content structure (sensu a Fedora content
	  model) is total valid tree of an information object, for instance an
	  entire document. Fedora comes equipped with an object oriented
	  data model capable of handling many different content structures.</p>

	  <p>There are a large number of mark-up languages available. All
	  languages aimed for textual documents builds upon a common theory of
	  text which is usually referred to as the Ordered Hierarchy of
	  Content Objects (OHCO) model. The model <a
	  href="http://www.stg.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html">is
	  problematic for various reasons</a>. The theory behind Fedora and
	  METS is basically the same, so they come, I suppose, with the same
	  problems.</p>

	</div>

	<div>

	  <h2>2.3. Resource and content description</h2>

	  <p>There are a few standards for the description, encoding and
	  transmission of structural metadata. We may distinguish between
	  descriptive encoding systems used within certain communities such as
	  <a
	  href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html">TEI
	  Manuscript Description</a> and <a
	  href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">Encoded Archival Description</a> that
	  are used to describe cultural heritage materials such manuscripts
	  and archives, whereas tools such as <a
	  href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/792">DIDL</a> can be used to describe
	  the contents inside multimedia objects of various kinds.</p>

	</div>

	<div>

	  <h2> 2.4 Dissemination of structure</h2>

	  <p>The dissemination and syndication of aggregates of resources is
	  simplified by standards such as <a
	  href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a>), (such as <a
	  href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-divilly-atom-hierarchy">Hierarchy
	  Relations for Atom</a>).

	  These standards are complemented by vocabularies such as IANA's
	  relation type vocabularies e.g., for use with <a
	  href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations.html">atom:link</a>
	  tag (compare the corresponding vocabulary for <a
	  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links">html
	  4</a> and <a
	  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links">html
	  5</a> ). </p>

	<p>The project will address three hypotheses:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    The normalization of structural information is essential for
	    making different media types available through a single user
	    interface.
	    <ul>

	      <li>This project will study methods for identification,
	      indexing, search and retrieval of arbitrary parts or segments of
	      structured information objects.</li>

	    </ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    The normalization should be based on metadata schemes or text
	    encoding formats, not applications, which embodies the data model.

	    <ul>
	      <li>This is in accordance with the philosophy that <a
	      href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/04/05/why-applications-are-like-fish-and-data-is-like-wine/">applications
	      are like fish and data is like wine, where only the latter
	      become more valuable as it ages.</a></li>

	      <li>The metadata schemes and text encoding formats should among
	      the successful ones according to the principles outlined by Tim
	      Bray in his article <a
	      href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070126140434/www.idealliance.org/proceedings/xml05/ship/175/xml2005.HTML">On
	      Language Creation</a></li>

	    </ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Items inside structured objects must be accessible through cool
	    persistent http URIs

	    <ul>
	      <li>The ability to address arbitrary points in texts, images or
	      videos is a basic requirement for using the resources in a
	      scholarly context, but also for annotation and <a
	      href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/002017.html">crowdsourced</a>
	      cataloging. Finally, without it, it is more or less impossible
	      to participate in the <a
