<h1>Towards the creation of metadata "aware"

<h3>Note added 2004</h3>
<p>Everything here is left as it was
when I used these slides for a presentation I held 1996 at the
<a
href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/papers/bl/ans-1996/">10th Anglo-Nordic Seminar</a>.
The theme of the Seminar this year was "networking".</p>
<p>I feel that everything here is obsolete. But maybe not: The problems we
tried to address at that time are not solved. Yet.
Nevertheless, a lot of of us
then actually believed that there could be a search engine for the Internet
which had the characteristics of a Library OPAC. We know now that such
search engines will never ever be developed.</p>
