<h1>Local area Harvesting</h1>

<ul>

<li>Typically a narrow range of
<a href="examples/metadata_statistics.html#local">metadata elements</a>. 
<a href="examples/report.html">Analysis</a>. 


<li>A modest range of controlled vocabularies, you controll their
semantics and can distribute them to content providers

<li>Typically very poor syntax, and unfortunately no <strong>generally
accepted alternative</strong>

<li>You may invent syntactic sugar to remedy poor syntax, <strong>and
you can really benefit from them, while being a pain for people
doing wide-area metadata harvesting</strong>.

<li>Legacy metadata is not as good as custom metadata (in SAFARI
around 70% of the metadata has been recycled from local databases). A
harvested metadata database will most likely never be as good as a
SBIG.

<li>Your robot is not as good as you think, and your content providers
servers are most likely much worse still.

</ul>
