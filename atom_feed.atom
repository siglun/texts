  <title>Focus on the resources</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/resourcecentric/"/>
  <summary>Having had a web site for about 15 years, I start to wonder why I
  keep it in the first place.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I've posted entries here under the heading <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/readings/">Readings on
      Digital Objects</a>. This text will, I hope, <strong>not</strong> be the
      last posting in that series, but you should not expect many more in the
      near future.</p>

      <p>Scholars as well as the general public consume digital objects en
      mass. The range of digital genres on the menu is broad, covering
      everything between Worlds of Warcraft and Shakespeare's Sonnets. An
      object delivered on the net via a library (in the broadest sense of that
      word) is a Digital Library Object. Those who have followed this series
      have realized that the research on what kind of data such an object
      should contain has been going on for more than a decade and possibly
      almost two.</p>

      <p>From a very early stage, the vision within the library communities
      has been to move the library to the Internet and particularly to the
      Web. The trend to establish a presence <q>where the users are</q> has
      been hysterical at times with libraries spending staff manpower on
      engagement in Second Life and Facebook.</p>

      <h3>Towards a resource centric view</h3>

      <p>Otherwise, the tactic has been the creation of repositories. We do
      now see now a shift from the repository as the gravitational center
      towards the objects, the resources, themselves. There should be no need
      to <strong>go to the</strong> digital library and search in what is
      basically hidden web. Rather the content should be on the Worldwide Web
      and available in the mainstream search engines.</p>

      <p>Lagoze et al. (2008) use this shift of emphasis as justification for
      proposal of the new standard OAI-ORE. They formulate the new trend in a
      very clear way:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>
	  <p>It [the OAI-ORE standard] also reflects a recognition of the
	  position of digital libraries vis-à-vis the Web that sometimes seem
	  to co-exist in a curiously parallel conceptual and architectural
	  space.</p>

	  <p>We exist in a world where information is synonymous not with
	  'library' but with the Web and the applications that are rooted in
	  it. In this world, the Web Architecture is the lingua franca for
	  information interoperability, and applications such as most digital
	  libraries must exist within the capabilities and constraints of that
	  Web Architecture.</p>
	</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Implementors of digital library objects have often successfully put
      the library collections on the web. They are also successfully
      disseminating simple bibliographical metadata (for example using
      OAI). Libraries have, however, been less successful as regards putting
      the objects on the Web (Lagoze, op. cit.)</p>

      <h3>XML &amp; SODA</h3>

      <p>Another point of failure is that we have yet been incapable of
      producing interoperable objects. Or, as McDonough (2008) puts it:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>
	  <p>Hence XML's similarity to a rope. Like a rope, it is
	  extraordinarily flexible; unfortunately, just as with rope, that
	  flexibility makes it all too easy to hang yourself.</p>
	</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Maly and Nelson (1999) make distinctions between Dumb and Smart
      Objects and Dumb and Smart Archives, leading to four architectures
      DODA, SODA, DOSA and SOSA. Ever since, object oriented developers have
      concentrated on the SODA model (Smart Objects in a Dumb archive. Fedora
      is intended as an implementation of that.</p>

      <p>I think it is time to give attention to the DODA architecture. Then
      the all inferencing and intelligence is deferred to an independent
      indexing agent which behaves more or less like an Internet search engine
      through clever indexing and automatic text analysis.</p>

      <p>Thursday morning. A clock went off in the bedroom. Very early. It was
      the calendar prompting me to attend a whole day event. The tablet
      synchronizes calendar entries from my outlook calendar. Very nifty, I'd
      say. <q>What was that?</q> my wife asked. <q>Oh, it was just my
      calendar,</q> I answered. <q>The standard <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HP100307951033.aspx">18

      <p>Yesterday she heard a pling from my left pocket. <q>An SMS?</q> she
      enquired. <q>Nope, an e-mail!</q> said I. <q>The alerts differ.</q></p>

      <p>I stand in the kitchen, by the stove, cooking.  I write while waiting
      for something to get ready, typing with frenzy on my tablet. <q>What are
      you up to?</q> asks she. <q>I'm just writing a text on my life as being

  <title>Bell's Books</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/bells/"/>
  <summary>I bought three books at Bell's Books, 536 Emerson Street, Palo
  Alto</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I bought three books (Fig. 1) at <a href="http://www.bellsbooks.com/">Bell's Books</a>, 536 Emerson Street,
      Palo Alto. This is a large, well kept (mostly antiquarian) bookshop with
      knowledgeable staff. I can recommend it wholeheartedly.</p>

      <div style="float:right;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/bells/20100509_001.jpg" alt="Three books acquired at Bell's Books, Palo Alto"><img width="100%" src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/bells/smaller20100509_001.jpg" alt="Three books acquired at Bell's Books, Palo Alto"/></a>
	<p><small>Fig. 1. I bought (from left to right) Wallace Stegner's
	<em>Little live things</em>, <em>The man who loved books too much</em>
	by Allison Hoover Bartlett and <em>A hole in the water</em> by Mae
	Briskin.</small></p>
	<p><small>I bought Stegner based on the first sentence in the book,
	Briskin because I like the title and Hoover Bartlett's book because
	I've actually met a book thief.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>How do people choose the books they read? In spite of the fact that
      I'm a very digital person, I choose a lot of the books I read based on
      the cover, typography, the feeling when you hold it and even their
      smell. Mostly, however, I choose certain authors, or read a bit in the
      beginning of the text, or the back cover. And yes, I read a lot of
      pocket books, as well.</p>

      <p>Of the three books, I've as yet only read Hoover Bartlett's on the
      Californian book thief.</p>

      <p>I've actually met a large scale book thief. The one operating at the
      Swedish Nation Library, and who dramatically ended his life in a gas
      explosion. Now he'll <a href="http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/boktjuvens-dubbelliv-blir-film_2476539.svd">become
      film</a>. We were in the same project group when we were building <a href="http://www.ediffah.org/">Ediffah</a>.</p>

  <title>Will the tablets change the world?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/tabletsagain/"/>
  <summary>I have previously discussed the impact of the tablet computer, an
  in particular iPad, and described how I've acqired one myself. Here I give
  some further pointers on the subject.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I have previously discussed the impact of the <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/ibooook/">tablet
      computer</a> and described how I've <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/n900/">acqired one
      myself</a>. Here I give some further pointers on the subject.</p>

      <p>Wired Magazine dedicated the cover and quite a few of its April issue
      to the appearance of the iPad. Here's two quotes:</p>

      <blockquote><em>[The iPad] will remake both book publishing and
      Hollywood, because it creates a transmedia that conflates books and
      video. You get TV you read, books you watch, movies you touch.</em>
      (<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays#kelly">Kevin
      Kelly</a>)</blockquote>

      <p>and</p>

      <blockquote><em>For decades, futurists have dreamed of the “universal
      book”: a handheld reading device that would give you instant access to
      every book in the Library of Congress. In the tablet era, it’s no longer
      technology holding us back from realizing that vision; it’s the
      copyright holders.</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays#johnson">Steven
      Johnson, 2010</a></blockquote>


      <p>I found this snippet on the effect of tablets on higher education:</p>

      <blockquote><em>Personally, I think that the current version of the iPad
      is the ultimate personal entertainment device, but one that has been
      designed for an ulterior purpose.  I believe the iPad is destined to
      become the first device/platform to make significant headway in the
      education space — particularly in higher education.</em> (<a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/2010/05/05/ipad-digital-learning/">Evan
      Schnittman </a>).</blockquote>

      <p>I can really recommend Evan Schnittman's blog <a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/">Black Plastic
      Glasses</a>.</p>

      <p>The previous object is something that came or occurred before the
      one at hand. The <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/atomlink/">previous
      installment</a> of my digital object series addressed the vocabulary
      used in the Atom link tag describing relations between
      URI's.</p>

      <p>Next means the nearest in place, degree, quality, rank, right or
      relation; having no similar object intervening. For page <em>n</em> the
      previous is page <em>n</em>-1 and the next is <em>n</em>+1. I haven't
      made up my mind about the next installment in this series.</p>

      <p>In the previous installment we discussed <kbd>up</kbd>,
      <kbd>first</kbd>, <kbd>previous</kbd>, <kbd>next</kbd> and
      <kbd>last</kbd>. Now we discuss the meaning of <kdb>next</kdb>. The next
      what? A vocabulary may be helpful:</p>

      <p>The National Library of Australia. <em>Australian METS Profile
      TYPE attribute vocabulary.  Version 1.0</em>

      <p>This list gives terms that can be used to describe content
      structure. The vocabulary is organized for the use in conjunc with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">Metadata Encoding and
      Transmission Standard</a> (METS). Using this approach permits
      Australians to write stuff like:</p>

  <title>A phone for elderly hackers?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/n900/"/>
  <summary>The young and smart people people have smart phones. But what phone
  should an old hacker choose. My answer is Nokia N900. The only snag is that
  this gadget isn't really a phone.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I've been looking with envy on all people around with flashy smart
      phones. All these iPhones and Androids. My problem has been: Should I
      aquire a phone capable of computing or a computer capable of
      phoning.</p>

      <p>I'm an open source - open access kind of person. I just cannot buy
      any i* gadget. Apple's business model is clever, but I need a device I
      can understand. I've been UNIX man for more than twenty years and to buy
      something without a shell would be unthinkable. On the other hand I'm
      using my computer for the same reasons as every one else. I.e., mostly
      surfing and communication. Which would be the same as a mobile internet
      device (a MID).</p>

      <p>In spite of the fact that I had settled that my next phone should be
      an Android one, the fate wanted that I should run into Nokia N900. This
      gadget weighs more than twice as much as an iPhone but you i think you
      should compare it with an iPad rather than with a cell phone. It is
      actually easier to send an email than to make phone call.</p>

      <p>Nokia doesn't market the thing as a phone but as very mobile
      computer. Yes, I do know that iPad has a screen which is (perhaps) six
      times as large as the one on N900. But I have checked out my entire web
      site from my CVS repository and I'm able to run the entire rebuild
      machinery. This is a computer that allows creativity.</p>

      <p>I did try to install emacs and nxml mode but that wasn't trivial. The
      OS is called <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a>, which is a Debian
      based Linux maintained by a community sponsored by Nokia. The
      development is promising since Nokia and Intel are joining forces and
      are merging forces. Their respective mobile OSes will merge into <a href="http://meego.com/">Meego</a> maintained by Linux foundation.</p>

	<p><small>The N900 is about as large as a state of the art smart
	phone, a bit larger when the keyboard is slid open. It is twice a
	thick as an iPhone, and when carried in your pocket it will
	bulge.</small></p>
      </div>


      <h3>Does it work?</h3>

      <p>Well. This is a very good little tablet computer.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Web</li>
	<li>Mail using POP and IMAP</li>
	<li>SMS and other messaging</li>
	<li>Voice phoning using 3G and Skype</li>
	<li>Calendar</li>
	<li>Synchonizing with Outlook</li>
	<li>Wifi and mobile internet</li>
	<li>GPS and supporting software</li>
	<li>Camera and images with geodata</li>
	<li>And much more</li>
      </ul>

      <p>... just works. Sometimes things aren't really as intuitive as you
      wanted. Or, perhaps, the intuition of the designers were not the one you
      expected but that is common, isn't it?</p>

      <h3>A phone for an olde UNIX hacker</h3>


      <p>There's a lot of other software. OpenOffice.org is here and then
      there is the whole lot of UNIX utilities. I can plot my data using
      Gnuplot and edit perl script with VI.</p>

      <p>So what about the screen and keyboard?</p>

      <p>The buttons on this thing are smaller than on my phone. You operate
      with your thumbs, and it does work. The suite supplied by Nokia uses
      some clever T9 like algorithm for guessing what you're typing which
      minimises the typing.</p>

      <p>The thing will keep you connected 24/7. The thing has 3D graphics,
      and should you like a shoot'em: DOOM is ported!</p>

  <summary>Atom syndication format contains everything you need to build 
  good annotation and navigation systems</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <h3 id="atomnavigation">Navigate</h3>

      <p>M. Nottingham &amp; R. Sayre, 2005. The Atom Syndication Format
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287</a></p>


      <p>The RFC 4287 specifies the Atom syndication format and states the
      following about</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7">
	<em>[t]he "atom:link" element [which] defines a reference from an entry or
	feed to a Web resource.  This specification assigns no meaning to the
	content (if any) of this element.</em> (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7">Section
	4.2.7</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p>The reference mentioned is given in the <kbd>href</kbd>
      attribute. The RFC does, clearly, not assign any semantics to the
      relation embodied by the tag. However, it continues discussing the
      <kbd>rel</kbd> attribute (those of you who know the elements of
      &lt;html:link/&gt; realizes that the two tags are very similar):</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>atom:link elements MAY have a "rel" attribute that indicates the
	link relation type.  If the "rel" attribute is not present, the link
	element MUST be interpreted as if the link relation type is
	"alternate". [...] If a name is given, implementations MUST consider
	the link relation type equivalent to the same name registered within
	the IANA </em> (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7.2">Section
	4.2.7.2</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p>The semantics of the relations are thus from a controlled list which
      is has an international maintenance agency, IANA. In a moment I'll
      discuss that list, but before I'll mention a few more useful attributes
      of the atom:link element: <kbd>title</kbd> and <kbd>hreflang</kbd>. The
      former <q>conveys human-readable information about the link</q> and the
      latter <q>describes the language of the resource pointed to by the href
      attribute</q>.</p>

      <p>Now, the vocabulary to be used for the <kbd>rel</kbd> attribute is
      maintained by <a href="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers
      Authority</a> (IANA) and published in the document <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">Atom
      Link Relations</a>. Each entry on this list has to be documented (which
      is usually done in an RFC). Here are obvious ones, such as:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><kbd>up</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>first</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>previous</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>next</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>last</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hence, here you have anything you need for navigating just about any
      content that may be modelled as a tree. And much more.</p>

      <h3 id="atomannotations">Annotate</h3>

      <p>J. Snell, 2006. Atom Threading Extensions
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685</a></p>

      <p>The Atom infrastructure for comments, discussions and annotations is
      described in RFC4685. The mechanism is simple:</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685#section-3">
	<em>The "in-reply-to" element is used to indicate that an entry is a
	response to another resource.  The element MUST contain a "ref"
	attribute identifying the resource that is being responded to.</em>
	(<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685#section-3">RFC 4685,
	Section 3</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <p>The <kbd>ref</kbd> 
      <q cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4685#section-3">attribute specifies
      the persistent, universally unique identifier of the resource being
      responded to</q>. In practice it will refer to the content of the
      <kbd>id</kbd> element of the annotated research, which is described in
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.6">RFC 4287</a>.</p>

      <p>So, you just add a reply-to link to your entry, and the entry has
      become an annotation. The rest is programming. <strong>;-)</strong></p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Carl Lagoze, Sandy Payette, Edwin Shin and Chris Wilper, 2005.
      Fedora: an architecture for complex objects and their
      relationships. <em>International Journal on Digital Libraries</em>. <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0501/0501012.pdf">http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0501/0501012.pdf</a></p>

      <p>This entry should have been about the paper mentioned above. It is
      only remotely related to it, I'm afraid.</p>

      <p>We are about to start implementing Fedora here at the Royal Library;
      our <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/stanford/">journey to
      Stanford</a> was about about that. The decision has been discussed at
      length and I think that it is wise, because when you build a
      repository of digital objects you need a uniform environment for
      metadata processing.</p>

      <p>Here I'm going to discuss XML processing, not metadata
      processing. Some may think Fedora isn't a tool for XML
      processing. However, it is often used that way.</p>

      <p>One caveat, the thoughts here are the opinions of one who have not
      yet used the package. However</p>

      <ol>
	<li>I have read the writings by Carl Lagoze et al. and also</li>
	<li>the information on the Fedora Commons web site.</li>
	<li>In addition I've had quite a few conversations with people
	involved with Fedora, including Carl himself at the turn of the
	century when he was very much involved in the project.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>So if you are willing to consider my predilections, read on. From my
      view, the use of Fedora is connected with some pitfalls. They are as
      dangerous as they are easy to circumvent.</p>

      <h3>Stale XML technology stack</h3>

      <p>In my view Fedora is basically JAXP &amp; Web technologies built on
      top of standards such as WSDL, SOAP &amp; XSD. It is not even a little
      <em>anno dazumal</em>, to me it is very much the obvious technology
      stack of year 2001. Today it is REST not SOAP, RelaxNG not XSD. Also we
      have now XQuery and other technologies that were just not invented
      <em>anno dazumal</em>.</p>

      <p>Since Fedora Commons 3.0 the entire Fedora API should be available
      through REST. <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/relax-wins/">XSD still
      sucks</a> (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/27/Choose-Relax">read
      this as well</a>), but I can live with it.</p>

      <h3>Poorly standardized container format</h3>

      <p>All objects in Fedora are ingested by formulating your data in <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/confluence/display/FCR30/Introduction+to+FOXML">Fedora
      Object XML</a> (FOXML), which is the format used internally in
      Fedora. Tim Bray (editor of the spec of XML 1.0) gives the following
      advice to anyone designing mark-up languages:</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://www.pdfpower.com/XML2005Proceedings/ship/175/xml2005.PDF"><em>Accept
      that there will be a clash between the model-centric and syntax-centric
      world-views, but bear in mind that successful XML-based languages
      support the use of multiple software implementations that cannot be
      expected to share a data model.</em> (<a href="http://www.pdfpower.com/XML2005Proceedings/ship/175/xml2005.PDF">Tim
      Bray, 2005</a>) </blockquote>

      <p>Seen from this perspective FOXML is not a good idea, being a typical
      object-oriented serialization used in one single implementation only,
      with one single datamodel. FOXML is poorly documented and usually used
      as a container for home brewed mixture of XML or RDF. That is, it has
      all characteristics of a loser language.</p>

      <p>Now, here I here we have to put this into perspective. If we look
      upon FOXML as <em>just</em> a serialized object and not as <em>the
      document format that will preserve our valuable data for posterity</em>,
      then FOXML is just another internal data format used inside a piece of
      software. Then I can live with FOXML. Indeed people invent such XML
      languages all the time to get their job done, and in comparison with
      those, then FOXML isn't that bad. In an object store with multiple
      document types this is almost the only way to do it, unless you've got
      an XML database.</p>

      <h3>Performance problems</h3>

      <p>The FOXML is usually indexed using a RDF triple store. However, the
      indexing process is computationally demanding and many implementors
      switch off this feature. A popular complement (or even replacement) is to
      index the data using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>,
      which is a high performance search and retrieval engine based on
      Apache Lucene.</p>

      <p>I can live with the indexing in Lucene or Solr. They are good.</p>

      <h3>In conclusion</h3>

      <p>I haven't even mentioned all the object oriented bindings. However,
      bindings can never be better than what they bind to. And that is FOXML
      and it sucks. It is just a poor quality language in comparison with TEI,
      DIDL, METS, MODS and ATOM.  It is good enough for a lot of purposes,
      though. Such as presenting the content of a METS file. You can do
      wonders with Fedora. But remember FOXML can never
      <strong>replace</strong> METS even if the Fedora people are better at
      UML. The METS community is better at XML.</p>

  <title>Does hypertext promote extractive interaction rather than
  immersive?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/extractive/"/>
  <summary>Extractive and immersive are two forms of interactivity. This note
  claims that the digital library services have successfully implemented
  facilities for extractive media consumption but that it is very difficult to
  help users in the immersive pattern.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>There is an academic genre often referred to as <em>New Media
      Research</em>. To what extent this pursuit really deserve the lable
      research I won't go into here. I usually find contributions from this
      area utterly boring. The <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/diglib/">digital
      revolution ended 1998</a> and hence all new the media are old by now,
      and that includes Twitter and Facebook. Period.</p>

      <p>In addition I find almost all comparisons between old and new medias
      tedious, inasmuchas that I seldom learn something new reading
      them. Similarly, any text starting with claims such that the ICT area is
      under rapid development will remain only partly read. Usually only the
      very first part. Unless the first few sentences contain something
      interesting <strong>and</strong> something that's new to me. Like the <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/gstupid/">article by
      Nicholas Carr I mentioned the other day</a>. Carr argues that we
      nowadays have difficulties immerse in really long texts, which to
      correspond to changes in mentality.</p>

      <p>I picked up two adjectives describing people's media consumption
      patterns: <em>Extractive</em> and <em>immersive</em>. The dichotomy
      seems to come from a paper by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lunenfeld">Peter Lunefeld</a>,
      who, is a student of interactive media, computer games etc. You'll find
      the two adjectives in connection with nouns as "navigation",
      "interaction" or gerunds like "<a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/2010/03/23/digital-reading/">reading</a>". As
      far as reading is concerned, I'll add <a href="http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/3/285">
      this paper</a> to my reading list. It analyzes the consequences of a
      spread of extractive reading behaviours from a language pedagogy
      perspective.</p>

      <p>What worries Carr is a shift from immersive to extractive reading and
      its psychological or even neurological consequences. I do both, a
      lot. On a personal level I can vividly recall my reading of the last
      volume in <a href="http://www.stieglarsson.com/Millennium-series">Stieg
      Larsson's Millenium Trilogy</a>. I just read one page more many houndred
      times that night, until the alarm went off, and I stumbled to the
      shower, the breakfeast and off to work trying to look as if I was able
      to do something useful. Such as coding new interfaces for media
      consumption.</p>

      <p>Does the digital revolution make people less able to immerse in books
      like Donald Knuth's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">The
      Art of Computer Programming</a></em> with about 650 pages per volume?
      Seven volumes are planned but three have yet to appear. Fascicle four
      was printed as recent as 2005. You need to able to immerse in books like
      that to devise search algorithms, so we may get into trouble with the
      next generation global search engines.</p>

  <title>Is Google Making us Stupid?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/gstupid/"/>
  <summary>Having had a web site for about 15 years, I start to wonder why I
  keep it in the first place.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      tell—but it’s changing.</em></blockquote>

      <p>writes Nicholas Carr, and continues a bit further down:</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/"><em>Immersing

      anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three
      pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else
      to do. I feel as if I’m always dragging my wayward brain back to the
      text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a
      struggle.</em></blockquote>

      <p>I first read this article in a printed Swedish translation. I was
      about a year and a half ago. Months later I found the original and
      started to read that. Initially I did not realize that I was actually
      rereading it, but for some reason I then returned to the translation and
      could establish the connection between. It was when I started to follow
      Carr's arguments in some detail that I recognized the article.</p>

      <p>Texts on the Internet are generally brief. I don't say that Fyodor
      Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky's texts somehow become more condensed in
      digital editions, but most texts are entries shorter than this one and
      they are shorter than articles in printed newspapers and magazines. We
      have accustomed ourselves to brevity and and perceive difficulties when
      reading longer texts. This is just the symptoms; Nicholas Carr reviews
      the evidence and I'm convinced. Our media consumption habits are
      changing, and he even manages to convince me that this affects the brain
      itself.</p>

      <p>Does it matter? Nicholas Carr does not even try to answer that
      question. It might be that the Internet brain has acclimatized itself to
      the new information environment, and that is neither good or bad. He
      mentions <q><em>Plato’s Phaedrus,</em> [in which] <em>Socrates
      bemoaned the development of writing. He feared that, as people came to
      rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to
      carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the
      dialogue’s characters, 'cease to exercise their memory and become
      forgetful.'</em> </q></p>

      <p>Then, through history, this bemoaning has been repeated at each step
      when media production and consumption passes through a new period of
      rapid development.</p>

      <p>Carr claims that Socrates was right: People's memory deteriorated
      when they no longer had to memorize Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and
      <em>Odyssey</em>. He also claims that for each of these historic changes
      the benefits have exceeded the drawbacks.</p>

      <p>We don't know if this will be the case this time, though.</p>

	  <small>Fig. 1. Information architecture level categories compared
	  with document architecture ones, as Helena Franke presents them. The
	  term <q>labelling</q> refers to how subjects or segments are
	  referred to in the navigation system. In the case of navigation
	  inside a document the labels are, I presume, equal to the chapter
	  and section headers.</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>This is a paper with a very simple take home message, which I
      reformulate here in my own words (Helena Franke might not agree): When a
      document, be it a book or an article or whatever is transformed to web
      content its content and expression (I've decided to adopt <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/buzzetti/">Buzzetti's
      terminology</a>) become a part of a web site's information architecture,
      or perhaps an extension of it. The usability of a digital text, does
      depend its literary and scientific quality, but also very much on how
      well the information is represented.</p>

      <p>Now, this might be obvious for those who consume media on the net,
      but unfortunately it is not obvious for many of those who produce
      digital editions on the same net, which is the reason I have waste so much
      HTML markup on this subject area.</p>

      use it. In spite of the fact that some people say it's dying. However,
      now when I'm more or less completetly converted to JAVA, we are actually
      discussing to switch part of our development to Ruby on Rails.</p>

  <title>Digital Representation and the Text Model</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/buzzetti/"/>
  <summary>Dino Buzzetti, 2002. Digital Representation and the Text Model. New
  Literary History, 33(1), p. 61-88.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Dino Buzzetti, 2002. Digital Representation and the Text Model.<em>New
      Literary History</em>, 33(1), p. 61-88.  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/20057710.pdf">http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/20057710.pdf</a></p>

      <p>I found this article by searching for <q>Ordered Hierarchy of
      Content Objects</q> (OHCO) in Google Scholar.</p>

      <p>The study and use of the theory and methodologies of text is either
      very practical, i.e., deployed by people attempting to use it for
      producing digital editions or text collections. It can also be extremely
      theoretical, i.e., it is used by people proving that it is impossible to
      represent text using such crude technologies such strongly embedded
      markup languages, such as Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML.</p>

      <p>It should not suprise you that the people discussing OHCO belong to
      the latter category. It is those who perceive problems that need to name
      them. And regardless of how many elements and attributes are added to
      the TEI, it is limited by the fact that it is XML.</p>

      <h3>Bumblebees and the theory of text</h3>

      <p>I am writing code for my living. I spend most of my time on practical
      problems. I'm about as interested in the intricacies of the theory of
      text as I am in flight mechanics theories proving that bumblebees are
      unable to fly.</p>

      <p>However, if you want a really good discussion about text, you have to
      turn to these contributions. They are written by people that are just as
      smart as the students of flight mechanics. Recently they managed to
      prove that bumblebees can fly which required more sofisticated
      mathematics and data. That is, it required new knowledge.</p>

      <p>Buzzetti's contribution is a classic in the area. It was published
      2002, but that version is a translation. The original was published in
      Italian 1999. That means that it was written somewhere in the interval
      1997-1999. That is, he might have started his research before XML
      even was a recommendation. Most of the tools we use today where not
      even on the drawing board. When he offers criticism against markup
      languages, he talks exclusively about SGML, the precursor of XML -- the
      much extended subset of SGML.</p>

      <h3>The Map isn't the Landscape</h3>

      <p>Anything which somehow depicts something else can be said to be a
      model, like a globe is a model of the earth. Buzetti focus two aspects
      of any model of a text.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>the information represented</li>
	<li>the represention of the information</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The first aspect is called the <em>content</em> of the text, whereas
      the second is referred to as an <em>expression</em> of it. For example,
      assume that you want to preserve a MS Word document. One way would be to
      <q>print</q> it to a file and transform that to a (i) high resolution
      bitmap as a (say) tif or jpeg2000. You could also export it as (ii)
      ASCII text. The former would be an expression of the text and the latter
      would be its content.</p>

      <p>The conventional wisdom says that we have two aspects of a text, its
      form and its content. Buzzetti doesn't mention this dichotomy at
      all. Rather, he says that an expression as well as the content may have
      a <em>form</em> and a <em>substance</em>. In his parlance, an
      <em>edition</em> is the set of the various contents and expressions
      available that can be linked to a work. The edition may then represented
      by <em>interpretations</em>.</p>

      <h3>Embedded vs. external encoding</h3>

      <p>Buzzetti is very much against the use of SGML. I will not go into his
      discussion of the lack of datamodels connected to the the markup, since
      the explosive development of XML technologies make that part of his
      criticism obsolete. The Document Object Model API supported by all major
      programming languages is just one of many answers to that critique.</p>

      <p>Buzzetti makes a distinction between strong and weak embedded
      markup. Languages that embed marks both at the beginning and at the end
      of character sequences inside a text are strongly embedded. Those that
      mark onsets are weakly embedded. Buzzetti is against strong embedding,
      but claims that text encoding ideally should be done without any
      embedded markup. By using that you blur the distincion between the
      form of substance.</p>

      <p>The ideal form of text encoding is to store the offsets, string
      lengths and corresponding semantics externally. Doing encoding this way
      you may support as many overlapping hierarchies of content objects your
      heart may desire. No hierarchy need to be given more importance all of
      them are are equal.</p>

      <h3>Buzzetti is right, but...</h3>

      <p>TEI doesn't do things this way. It isn't because Buzzetti isn't
      right. I'm sure he is. Those who did text encoding thought that SGML was
      good enough. Now we think that XML is OK and practical to use.</p>

      <p>The designers of TEI choose to give a priority to the logical
      structure of the texts we are encoding. That is, since we are allowed to
      have one single hierarchy, we use it for encoding the
      <em>content</em>. I.e., the chapters, sections, paragraphs and
      phrases. We don't use it for pages, lines and characters which belong to
      the <em>expression</em>. We regard the page and line breaks as points in
      the character stream and add empty tags for them. These empty tags are
      called <em>milestones</em>. If we accept some computational difficulties
      we can encode a lot using this machinery, including insertions and
      deletions of text across (for example) paragraphs.</p>

      <p>But, yes, our encoded text is an expression of the content, and we
      have limited the range possible interpretations of the text.</p>

  <title>A Safari among Subscription Libraries</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/subscriptions/"/>
  <summary>I have been a subscriber to O'Reilly's Safari services for quite
  some years now. Recently I upgraded the subscription such that I get access
  to the entire stock without limitations.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>The <a href="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/">London Library</a> is
      an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_library">independent
      subscription library</a>. In the UK there are quite a few libraries of
      this kind left, in spite of the fact that it is more or less an
      anachronism. There are enough of them to organize themselves in an <a href="http://www.independentlibraries.co.uk/">Association of Independent
      Libraries</a>. The London Library is the largest member of the
      organization, and it is also the one with the highest membership fee.</p>

      <p><a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>, the book publishling
      company, has an <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">online
      subscription library</a>, perhaps mainly aimed at technical people like
      myself. I've had a personal subscription for quite some time, and I
      recently I upgraded the subscription such that I have unlimited access
      to the entire stock. The fee is $53.74 (including VAT 25%). That's
      $656.88 per annum which is £398.60. This is an interesting figure, since
      the annual membership fee for The London Library is £395.00.</p>

      <p>I let Safari describe itself in a quotation from its top page:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Online access to books, videos, and tutorials from Peachpit, New
	Riders, Adobe Press, O'Reilly, lynda.com and others.</em><sup><a href="#notesafari">1</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The London Library takes a more intellectual stance on its home
      page:</p>

	<em>The London Library has long played a central role in the
	intellectual life of the nation, serving generations of readers and
	writers throughout the country - and beyond - by lending material from
	its remarkable collections, and by providing a rare literary refuge in
	the heart of the capital. Membership is open to all.</em><sup><a href="#notell">2</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Is a comparison relevant?</h3>

      <p>The London Library has a very differen <q cite="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/join/faqs.htm">subject range
      [which] is mainly within the humanities, and the collection is
      particularly strong in history, literature (including fiction),
      biography, art, philosophy, religion and related fields</q><sup><a href="#note1">3</a></sup>. The library aquires both books and
      periodicals, and has similar services as a university library when it
      comes to electronic journals and access to databases.</p>

      <p>The Safari Subscription Library is aiming at another audience, but
      appart from that the two has basically the same business model. They
      gather media and provide access to paying customers. Safari does not
      help you if you're about to write your thesis in computer science,
      whereas The London Library would do that for a serious student of
      history.</p>

      <p>The obvious difference between the two on the one hand and the public
      library system on the other is the funding. The London Library is a
      charity, but otherwise it is as dependent on its customers as is
      Safari. Besides, both offers subscription schemes for public libraries
      and other businesses. Last but not least, both of them supply
      quality.</p>

      <p>So, yes, the comparison is meaningful. In particular, it is
      interesting to see how a surviving speciemen of the precursors of
      the modern library is so very much like what could possibly be what may
      come after.</p>

  <title>George Smiley and libraries</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/04/smiley/"/>
  <summary>I'm an ardent John le Carré reader. In particular I'm very fond of
  the books about George Smiley.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Year 1986 is special since it is the year I spent as a PosDoc in
      London. During that year I ran into John le Carré's books. Some of my
      spare time, quite a few weekends actually, I spent as a literary tourist
      in London.</p>

      <p>I bought and read a handful of le Carré's books.
      In particular, those about the old spy master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smiley">George Smiley</a> and
      of those, it is in particular the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smiley#The_Karla_trilogy">The
      Karla Trilogy</a> I like the most. George Smiley is an academic,
      germanist and a spy. During the thirties he had operated under cover in
      Germany and during the World War II he ran networks in Germany, Sweden
      and Switzerland. If you are to believe the Wikipedia article about
      him. I've just recently had a very nice time enjoying <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/smiley-season/">BBC's Smiley
      Season</a> and rereading <em>The Secret Pilgrim</em>.  </p>

      <p>The trilogy consists of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker,_Tailor,_Soldier,_Spy">Tinker
      Tailor Soldier Spy</a></em> (1974) which tells the story on how Smiley
      tracks down a Soviet mole inside British intelligence, 

      <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable_Schoolboy">The
      Honourable Schoolboy</a></em> (1977) on how he restores the "Circus" to
      something that looks like an intelligence service

      and finally <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley%27s_People">Smiley's
      People</a></em> (1979) on how he finally forces his old Soviet adversary
      with code name Karla to defect.</p>

      <div style="float:right;width:40%;margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/press/General%20library%20images.htm" title="The reading room at the London Library">

	  <img src="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/press/photos/General%20library%20images/picture-005.jpg" width="100%" alt="The reading room at the London Library"/>
	</a>
	<p><small>The reading room at the London Library. It is hard to tell
	whether the window is a sash-window, or if there are trees
	outside.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>The first and the last of the three books have in common that George
      is called in from his retirement. An important part of Smiley's
      character is his involvement in various scholarly pursuits, like the
      writing of a monograph about the bard Opitz.  In <em>Smiley's
      people</em> George</p>

      <blockquote>
	[...] <em>was toiling obliviously, with whatever conviction he could
	muster, at his habitual desk in the London Library in St James's
	Square, with two spindly trees to look at through the sash-window of
	the reading room [...] for at the time he was writing a monograph on
	the bard Opitz and trying loyally to distinguish true passion from the
	literary convention of the period.</em><sup><a href="#londonlib">1</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Passion is not a characteristic of George, but his work requires not
      only borrowed books, but also scholarly journals, and the library
      reminds him of expired loans:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>What was due?</em> German Life and Letters? Philology? Philology
	<em>he decided; it was already overdue. Putting on the hall light he
	stooped and peered through his post.</em><sup><a href="#whatisdue">2</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>From what I can tell from the <a href="http://lms3.londonlibrary.co.uk/F">London Library's catalogue</a>,
      it has <em>German Life and Letters</em> in its holdings since 1936, but
      not any journal called <em>Philology</em> there.</p>

      <p>The London Library is an UK Registered Charity and a <a href="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/join/individualmembership.htm">membership
      lending library</a>. The staff were at the time not particularly
      interested in showing the reading room for literary tourists. I think
      that this <a href="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/visit/index.htm">may
      have changed somewhat</a>. Some day I will go to London visit the London
      Library and look through the window in the reading room. Maybe there are
      still two trees outside the sash-window. I suppose that they must have
      grown since the seventies, though.</p>

  <title>A new line in the list</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/appteixml/"/>
  <summary>I've spent half of this week writing an Internet draft</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>If you're involved in what goes on on the Net at a technical level
      then you will at some stage run into acronyms asuch ISOC, IESG and
      IETF. They are, respectively, short for <a href="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/">Internet Engineering Steering Group</a>
      and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task
      Force</a>.</p>

      <p>Even if industry has contributed a lot to the development of Internet
      it has done so through these organizations. Furthermore, the Net as we
      know it with its standards, traditions and concepts comes from
      Academia. Internet grew out of a research project financed by the US
      Navy, which supported research at US universities such as University of
      California at Berkeley.</p>

      <p>These organizations keep track of their histories. Indeed the best
      Internet history comes from the IETF in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2235">Request For Comments
      2235</a>.</p>

      <h3>IANA</h3>

      <p>There is another important entity on the Internet. The <a href="http://www.iana.org">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a>
      (IANA). This organization has in its care the <em>Internet Root
      Zone</em>, that is it owns the name server that rules them all.</p>

      <p>IANA is also keeping track of <strong>the list</strong> of MIME <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">media types</a>. To
      explain the significance of this list, you have to think about all those
      times when you've failed to open some file sent to you with
      e-mail. That's what happens when the sender's message header contains an
      erroneous MIME media type.</p>

      <p>Laurent Romary and myself have spent quite some time this week
      writing an Internet draft.  The purpose of that draft is to add a single
      line on the list of media types, containing the string <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/teimime/">application/tei+xml</a>.</p>

  <title>The syndication of style &amp; layout</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/syndication/"/>
  <summary>Quite a few and perhaps a majority of my readers seldom visits my
  site. This entry is about the problems of syndication and how you are
  limited by the styling and layout on the site where your material is
  presented.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>The most frequently retrieved document from this site is my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SigfridLundbergsStuff?format=xml">syndication
      feed</a>. I can tell that from the otherwise lousy statistics provided
      by my ISP. I also use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google
      Analytics</a>, and the crude statistics from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedBurner">FeedBurner</a>. Analytics
      doesn't tell me anything about the use of the feed, since I cannot embed
      javascript in a feed. Only Googlebot (I use it as a Google Sitemap) and
      Feedburner accesses the feed directly. The rest of you get the feed via
      Feedburner.</p>

      <p>Feedburner keeps a cache, and refreshes that every 30 minutes. The
      feed is retrieved around 250 times a week, and I would have expected
      2*24*7=336 hits on the feed. Note that 250 includes Googlebot. Since
      I've no direct access to the Apache log files I cannot tell how the file
      is retrieved. If I was Google I would add an
      <kbd>If-Modified-Since</kbd> header to my GET request and looked for a
      Status 304 (not modified) in the response. Then I could get away with a
      much lower access frequency and gain throughput. This would explain the
      slightly lower access rate than expected.</p>

      <p>My estimate is that about five to ten persons visits my site daily
      and that two or three of them read something. Furthermore, between ten
      and fifteen readers follow me using the feed. In particular the use
      stats for the feed is hard to evaluate.</p>

      <h3>Headless Layout &amp; Absolute Links</h3>

      <p>All the entries on this site are written directly in Atom using nxml
      mode for Emacs. The <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/colophon/">site is
      generated</a> from this source using a number of different scripts, the
      bulk of it written in XSLT. The source file for this entry is <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/syndication/syndication.atom">here</a>.
      There are two things you have to think about when you write and design
      your content for syndication:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Your content will be rendered in sites which isn't yours: You
	cannot use relative URIs, and a lot of your javascript won't
	work.</li>

	<li>You have to manage without the
	<kbd>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</kbd> and everything you normally
	would put there which implies that you can not use
	<kbd>&lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;</kbd> elements and that you are
	unable to define CSS classes.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The problem with javascript manifests itself differently. <a href="http://grazr.com">grazr.com</a> has a nice category browser, which
      can be used on some of <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/">KB's
      data</a>. It seases to work at least when stuff is syndicated on Google
      Hompepage.</p>

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/syndication/screenshot.png" title="Entry on Google Homepage">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/syndication/screenshot.png" width="100%" alt="Entry on Google Homepage"/>
	</a>
	<p><small>Fig. 1. My <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/stanford/">previous
	entry</a> as it appears on my iGoogle Homepage. Note that all the
	captions appear next to the first two images, not as they should
	adjacent to each corresponding one. This is Google Chrome but it looks
	the same in Firefox.</small></p>
      </div>


      <p>When I write these entries I preview them using the server I run on
      my laptop. Making the links absolute is the last thing I do before
      publishing to the web. I forget this now and then, and I won't see that
      before it has been through feedburner and reached google and
      bloglines. The rebuild-run-debug cycle is long for syndicated
      content.</p>

      <p>There might be problems with the feed readers' HTML support. I'm
      currently only the online ones, iGoogle and Bloglines, so the html
      shouldn't theoretically not be a problem on them, but still there
      is.</p>

      <p>One is that (for instance) Google defines stuff in its CSS which
      changes the behaviour of tags in a way such that my content does not
      look as intended. The <kbd>&lt;kbd&gt;...&lt;kbd&gt;</kbd> (keyboard)
      didn't work the last time I checked. The other problem is that (for
      instance) Google actually edits my markup. It seems that in my previous
      entry, the one about stanford, Google stripped the <kbd>&lt;br
      clear="all"/&gt;</kbd> elements from its attribute
      (<kbd>clear="all"</kbd>) and that CSS redefines the break tag in some
      way or another (see Fig. 1).</p>

      <h3>An experiment</h3>

      <p>Please bear with me. Below you find the content from my previous
      entry. In this version I'm employing some other methods for achieving a
      break. I indicate in the text which method I use.</p>

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">

      <p>A lovely garden somewhere between our hotel and the Meyer Library at
      Stanford University. Break is the original <kbd>&lt;br
      clear="all"/&gt;</kbd>. Predicted behaviour: No break will be
      generated in Google.</p>

      with <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/thinking/">the
      Rodin in Copenhagen.</a> Break is using CSS <kbd>&lt;br
      style="clear:both;"/&gt;</kbd> Predicted behaviour: Will not generate a
      break if Google strips all attributes on &lt;br/&gt; and generate one if
      it just strips clear</p>

      <br style="clear:both;"/>

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">

      </div>

      <p>A nice graffiti, or is it al fresco? And what is the difference?
      Break is using an empty <kbd>&lt;div
      style="clear:both;"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</kbd>. Predicted behaviour: Will
      generate a break in Google.</p>

  <title>On indexing of XML using XSLT</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/xslt_indexer/"/>
  <summary>One of my really deep interests is the indexing of complex XML
  content. Please find here the home page of one my software projects,
  xslt_indexer</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Back in July last year, I promised that I should return to how <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/xslt_extensions/">xslt
      extensions</a> could be used to index arbitrary XML documents.</p>

      <p><kbd>xslt_indexer</kbd> is a JAVA application that I wrote a few
      years ago. It is used in some applications, such as the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm">Guaman
      Poma Web Site</a>.</p>

      <p>The search engine is Apache Lucene, and the indexing engine is based
      on Xalan Java. The principle is that you use xslt to create and save
      lucene documents, and you can use xslt constructs to insert text into
      arbitrary fields in the lucene documents.</p>

      <p>Please find here</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/xslt_indexer/xslt_indexer.tar.gz">xslt_indexer.tar.gz</a></li>

		<li><a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/xslt_indexer/javadoc/">The javadocs</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Beware though that this is work in progress, although the rate of
      progress is very low. I've put it online mostly for the purpose of
      publishing the idea. The error handling is virtually absent.</p>

  <summary>Nick Nicholas, Nigel Ward and Kerry Blinco helps obscuring the
  digital identifiers concept</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Nick Nicholas, Nigel Ward and Kerry Blinco Abstract presents
      discusses at length in the article <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue62/nicholas-et-al/">Modelling of
      Digital Identifiers</a>.</p>

      <p>About eighty percent of the paper presents a taxonomy of possible
      identifiers. I hope that the authors enjoyed the intellectual exercise
      writing it.</p>

      <p>The remaining twenty percent disputes the current usage of URIs for
      identification, and in particular the use of HTTP URIs that can easily
      be dereferenced.</p>

      <p>I want to make one thing clear. What interests me is hypertext
      linking. In my world I working with resources that are overlapping
      hierarchies of content objects, where the access point or anchor is to
      be decided by the user and not the service provider.</p>

      <p>Nicholas et al. are interested in something else. I cannot understand
      why they find these other things are useful. To me they are just
      boring.</p>

  <title>Blomgrens noter och mina</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/danceminuette/"/>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Detta är slutrapporten för ett misslyckat projekt från 2003.</p>

      <p>Tankarna på projektet grundlades när jag (några år tidigare och
      av misstag) införlivade CDn <a href="http://www.hurv.com/svenska/frames/frame-holder.htm">Dance Minuets
      1731-1801</a> av Anders Rosén och Ulf Störling i mina samlingar.  I det
      lilla informativa häftet skriver Anders: <q>En polska låter aldrig
      vackrare än som avslutning till en menuett då kontrasten framhäver
      egenarten i båda danserna.</q> Detta slog an en sträng i mitt sinne.
      Jag skulle lära mig att spela menuett!  Varje menuett skulle skulle jag
      avsluta med en passande polska.  Eftersom jag kanske är mer
      tidig-musik-nörd än spelman borde detta passa mig bra.  Ty, som Anders
      Rosén skriver, <q>under en tid vid mitten av 1700-talet ingick
      t.o.m. danserna och melodierna en symbios, så att det ibland var svårt
      avgöra var den ena slutar och den andra tar vid</q>.</p>

      <div style="width:66%;float:left;margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/danceminuette/blomgren_menuette.png" title="Menuett efter Johan Eric Blomgren">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/danceminuette/blomgren_menuette.png" alt="Menuett efter Johan Eric Blomgren" style="width:100%;"/>
	</a>
	<p><small>Menuett från Blomgrens arkiv vid Sveriges Visarkiv</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>Den största enskilda bidragsgivaren till låtarna i häftet var Johan
      Eric Blomgren, född 1757.  För att sätta in Blomgren i musikhistoriens
      kronologi kan det kanske vara intressant att notera att Johan Eric
      föddes bara sju år efter J.S. Bachs död, och därmed var han också ett år
      yngre än Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Förmodligen hade man på den skånska
      landsbygden knappt hunnit märka att barocken var på väg att ge vika för
      klassicismen.  Blomgren, som är välkänd för de som intresserar sig för
      gammal skånsk musik, var verksam som organist och fiolspelman i
      Hässlunda. I samlingarna efter Blomgren finns en avskrift av Wolfgangs
      pappas lärobok i violinspel.</p>

      <p>Jag började alltså sommaren med en CD, ett nothäfte jag likaledes
      förvärvat från skivbolaget Hurv och Skånedelen av svenska låtar.  Den
      sistnämnda eftersom Roséns och Störlings CD och nothäfte bara innehöll
      menuetter, polskorna fick jag plocka från annat håll.  Men juli månad
      gick all världens väg utan att jag lärde mig en enda av Blogrens
      menuetter.  Det tog emot, och jag ville gärna para ihop stycken innan
      jag tog itu med själva instuderingen.</p>

      <p>Under semestern gjorde familjen och jag själv en tur till Stockholm,
      och jag beslöt mig för att sätta mig en dag på Svenskt Visarkiv för att
      se om Blomgren själv kunde ge mig en ledtråd.  Tanken var att man kanske
      kunde hitta kommentarer eller någon sorts struktur i nothäftena som
      belyste frågan om hur Johan Eric Blomgren valde att spela sina
      låtar.</p>

      <h3>Hur organiserar en spelman sina noter?</h3>

      <p>Min egen notsamling är i en förfärlig röra.  Det jag spelar mest är
      svensk folkmusik, men även en del danser från renässansen och
      barocken.</p>

      <p>I mina hyllor har några jag några pärmar och mappar med
      fotostatkopior med noter, vilka kommer från olika tider i mitt liv.  En
      mapp från sjuttiotalet med progg.  En tjock pärm från åttiotalet finns
      massor av visor och slagdängor efter titel; i den är <em>all</em>
      folkmusik samlad under <strong>F</strong>.</p>

      <p>Mot slutet av åttiotalet kom våra barn...  och då kom det inte fler
      kopior.  På hyllan står det i stället några böcker med barnvisor.</p>

      <p>Noterna jag samlat under de senaste femton åren ligger lösa i högar
      och mappar. De är ordnade i enlighet med ett intrikat system som
      uppkommer efter efter hur ofta jag spelar dem. Jag plockar ut den sökta
      låten ur högarna -- om jag nu hittar den -- och lägger tillbaka den
      överst.</p>

      <p>Jag har frågat runt bland vänner:</p>

      <p><q>Jag spelar inte så mycket efter noter</q>, sa en duktig spelman
      jag känner.</p>

      <p>Efter viss övertalning medgav han, motvilligt, att han faktiskt hade
      en notsamling.  Han hade en del dalalåtar från en kurs han gått i
      Malung. De låg för sig.  De skånska låtar för sig.  Inom varje
      ursprungskategori låg de sorterade efter dans.</p>

      <p>Åter till Blomgren.  Hur organiserade Johan Eric sin samling?
      Visarkivet har en mapp med häften efter honom och hans söner och andra
      släktingar. De äldsta är efter honom själv, men i några ser man byten av
      handstil.  Den äldsta är ett relativt tunt häfte med beteckningen Ma13a.
      Omslaget förkunnar:</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;"><em>Note-Bok Till Violin<br/>
      J.E. Blomgren Näslunda 1781</em></h3>

      <p>med en vacker, jämn och sirlig piktur.  Han hade inte någon kartong,
      utan lade samman flera lite tjockare ark papper som han sydde ihop runt
      kanterna med ett ganska kraftigt snöre.  Häftet innehåller nio låtar,
      varav sju menuetter.  I början och slutet hade han skrivit ner
      polonesser.  Det här häftet sticker ut genom ett större format än de
      övriga.  Låtarna är bara skrivna på en sida.  Pappret är tunt och hade
      han skrivit på båda sidorna hade bläcket trängt genom, och låtarna
      blivit svårlästa.</p>

      <p>Johan Eric linjerade förmodligen sina notblad själv.  Hur han gjorde
      kan jag bara gissa.  Alla notlinjer är perfekt parallella, och om han
      darrade med handen märks det på alla fem notstrecken.  Han måste haft
      ett pennskaft för fem spetsar och dragit alla linjerna på en gång.  En
      penna som inte är så olik en gaffel, alltså.</p>

      <p>Notarken är vikta på mitten och fastsydda i ryggen på den handgjorda
      pärmen. Han måste alltså ha linjerat halva arket på framsidan, och på
      vänt på det och linjerat andra halvan på andra sidan.  I det färdiga
      häftet skev han bara på högersidorna.  Allting tyder på att det var ett
      häfte som han ville visa upp med glädje, inte någon anteckningsbok han
      spontant skrev i när han lärt sig något nytt.</p>

      <p>Johan Eric hade sådan nothäften också.  Ett av dem liknade mina
      pärmar och mappar från sjuttio- och åttiotalen.  Det innehöll allmänt
      och blandat: <em>God save the King</em> och åtskilliga andra stycken
      stycken okända för mig. Låtarnas namn är på engelska, tyska och franska.
      Kanske är det slagdängor från 1700-talets sista årtionden.  En låt med
      titeln <q>Tune requiring double tounge</q> antyder att han kopierat ur
      en lärobok för träblåsare.</p>

      <p>Jag har en massa fotokopier av låtar jag aldrig lärde mig. Det kostar
      så lite att kopiera, men det tar betydligt mera tid att skriva. Bläck
      och papper kostar, och man måste linjera arken själv. Jag tror inte
      Johan Eric skrev av låtar som han inte trodde att han ville spela. Å
      tror jag att han hade mer tålamod än jag.</p>

  <title>Idempotency and HTTP methods</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/modactions/"/>
  <summary>Idempotency is actually the feature of HTTP that makes Worldwide
  Web</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I've been working with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST
      paradigm for years</a>. Or that is what I've claimed. But really, what
      I've been delivering is really GETful web services. These are services
      delivering all services using GET-requests, which good if you're
      actually just delivering content. But REST the architecture behind the
      IT revolution. And central in the WWW is HTTP and there in the midst
      you'll find the HTTP methods.</p>

      <div style="float:right;width:33%;margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;">
	<table style="width:100%;">
	  <caption>Tab. 1. The methods defined in HTTP 1.1. Safe methods
	  should not take any other action than retrieval. An idempotent
	  method is one that has the same side effects if it is applied
	  <em>n</em> times (<em>n</em>&gt;0), as when it it is applied
	  once.</caption>

	  <tr>
	    <th>Method</th>
	    <th>safe</th>
	    <th>idempotent</th>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td>HEAD</td>
	    <td>Yes</td>
	    <td>Yes</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td>GET</td>
	    <td>Yes</td>
	    <td>Yes</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td>DELETE</td>
	    <td>No</td>
	    <td>Yes</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td>PUT</td>
	    <td>No</td>

	    <td/>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td>OPTIONS</td>
	    <td/>
	    <td/>
	  </tr>

	</table>
      </div>

      <p>You can do a lot using REST and the set of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">methods
      defined for HTTP 1.1</a>. I've put the method in Tab. 1. I'd like to
      dwell on the idempotency concept as applied to computing. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#In_computing">quote
      directly from Wikipedia</a>:</p>

      <blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
	<p style="margin-left:+5%;">In computer science, the term idempotent
	is used to describe methods or subroutine calls that can safely be
	called multiple times, as invoking the procedure a single time or
	multiple times has the same result; i.e., after any number of method
	calls all variables have the same value as they did after the first
	call.</p>


	<p style="margin-left:+5%;">This is a very useful property in many
	situations: It means that an operation can be repeated or retried as
	often as necessary without causing unintended effects. If the
	operation were non-idempotent, it would be necessary to keep track of
	whether it was already performed or not, which complicates many
	algorithms.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Let us make the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/aug/14/hans-christian-rsted-birthday">gedanken
      experiment</a> that the retrieval methods, GET and HEAD, in HTTP where
      <strong>not idempotent in exactly this sense</strong>. Lean back, close
      your eyes and meditate over the problem: <em>Which sequence of pages
      would be necessary to retrieve <strong>today</strong> in order to get
      the original <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf">DNA</a>
      structure.</em></p>

      <p>To put it in another way: Idempotency is the feature of HTTP ensuring
      that you receive predictable content when you dereference an URI, rather
      than a my personalized version of, say, Watson &amp; Crick.</p>

  <summary>In a recent article Theresa Velden &amp; Carl Lagoze (Communicating

  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>In a recent article Theresa Velden &amp; Carl Lagoze
      <em>Communicating chemistry</em>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v1/n9/full/nchem.448.html">Nature
      Chemistry 1, 673-678 (2009)</a> discusses how traditions and attitudes
      concerning IPR affect data sharing and how that in turn affects
      scientists propensities to use web 2.0 tools and web of data
      technologies.</p>

      <p>They address the problem why chemists, as opposed to (say) physicists
      and molecular biologists are late adopters of Web 2.0 and
      OpenAccess. These two are entirely different entities. The former is a
      set of technologies and the second is a business model for the
      publishing industry. Nevertheless, they are related.</p>

      <h3>Chemistry is a bit different</h3>

      <p>Chemical and pharmaceutical industry are large employers of
      chemists. Velden &amp; Lagoze mentions that ACS has 155000 members. Of
      them <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/acsnews/87/8710salary.html"> 62%
      works within industry</a>. As a comparison, American physical Society
      has <a href="http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200902/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=159887">47189
      members (year 2009)</a> but only about <a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/urpas/summary_of_aps_report_on_physicists_in_industry">20%
      of them work within industry</a>. On the other hand, the same US source
      claims that 56% of all physics PhDs worked in industry. </p>

      <p>I don't think that the proportion of chemists working within industry
      is high compared with people having training in engineering or computer
      science. However, chemistry should be compared with the other sciences
      not with engineering. Here chemistry appears to be a bit different in
      comparison with physics or earth and life sciences.</p>

      <p>Chemistry is the science where a the largest proportion of all
      researchers just consume scientific publication, but not contribute. It
      should, conclude Velden &amp; Lagoze, not conclude anyone that IPR
      thinking and secrecy more common within chemistry than elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Chemistry has fewer OpenAccess journals than most other part of
      science, and chemists are less interested in social media kind of
      e-science than are most other branches.</p>

      <h3>Infrastructure</h3>

      <p>In spite of this, there are some really interesting developments
      coming from chemistry. Velden &amp; Lagoze mentions</p>

      <blockquote><em>a standardized chemical mark-up language, a computable
      identifier for organic molecules (the IUPAC international chemical
      identifier, or InChI), open-source tools for the manipulation and
      management of chemical information6, and the use of free, hosted Web 2.0
      services to support 'open-notebook science'</em></blockquote>

      <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jcbradley/scholar2scholar-presentation">This
      open lab notebook</a> is interesting. It is fascinating to see how an
      e-science infrastructure makes use of off-the shelf wiki and blog
      software and combine these with storage in Google apps and communicates
      via syndication feeds.</p>

     <p>It has been a long and harsh winter here in Scandinavia. I am one of
     those who hate the cold darkness which characterizes my part of the
     world. Many of us have been thinking about the weather (Fig. 1).</p>

     <p>Since christmas I've been involved two projects, one of which is
     currently approaching deliverable. Unfortunately it has been delayed but
     on the other hand I've got the opportunity to learn <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/aformwithajoin/" title="A Form with a Join">Xforms</a>. I think that both the library and
     myself will benefit from it.</p>

     <p>The other project, a redesign of our Digital Object Management System
     (DOMS), is approaching a journey to Stanford together with some good
     colleagues.</p>

     <p>Those of us who <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/">commute</a>
     has had problems during the winter (Fig. 2). Regardless of how we travel,
     most of us look forward to the spring (Fig. 3).</p>

      </div>

      <h2>New projects</h2>

      <p>I have two really stimulating projects which will keep me occupied
      for the better part of the coming year. The most important one for me is
      that I've been given the opportunity to spend one quarter of my time on
      basic research into digital library objects.</p>

      <p>The idea is to start from the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=soda%20model%20dumb%20archive&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ws">Smart
      Object Dumb Archive</a> (SODA) model. It is an old model, but there is
      not many alternatives.  There are a number of new approaches that look
      very much like SODA, such as the successful <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">.epub format</a> and the formats used within
      <a href="http://www.upnp.org/">Universal Plug and Play</a>. UPnP
      distributes both metadata and digital objects such as music and film
      within a local area network.</p>

      <p>The second project is still just planning but here I will contribute
      to a new critical edition of Ludvig Holbergs collected work.</p>

      <p>White reflects radiation from the sun to a larger degree than do

      caused the melting of some snow.</p>

  <title>A form with a join</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/aformwithajoin/"/>
  <summary>A form is a document, or part of one, that can be used for the
  entry of data. A join is a construct in query languages such SQL. A join
  allows you to lookup data in one part of a database based on a query in an
  other part. Joins are very general, and may appear in other contexts. Such
  as the XML forms language.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>A <strong>form</strong> is a document, or a part of one, that can be
      used for the entry of data. A <strong>join</strong> is a construct in
      query languages such SQL. A join allows you to lookup data in one part
      of a database based on a query in an other part. Joins are general, and
      may appear in other contexts than SQL. Such as XQuery, XSLT and XML
      forms language, XForms. I've recently written my first extensive
      application in that language. It required a larger effort than I had
      expected.</p>

      <p>Having worked with XML processing for more than ten years, I had
      thought that I would easily be able to relate to a new XML technology by
      extrapolating from my earlier experiences. This has hitherto been the
      case. For instance, learning Xerces in java when I've used dom4j in java
      and XML::LibXML in perl was a piece of cake. If you have used the
      venerable Expat callback based parser, the idea behind SAX or Stream API
      for XML (StaX) are quite obvious.</p>

      <p>One could expect that if you know XML technologies and HTML forms you
      would easily grasp XForms. Having realised that this wasn't the case I
      thought that having learned XPath and XSLT I would easily grasp
      XForms. That was true, but only partly. A small part.</p>

      <h3>UI and Events</h3>

      <p>An XForm script, just as an XSLT one, can read XML documents and act
      upon them. The result is very different. XSLT generates another
      document, usually an XML one. The XForm generates a form, a graphical
      user interface. And it is usually one that can be used for editing
      XML. A user interface is event driven, an there are a whole lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events">events to keep track
      of</a>.</p>

      <div style="float: right; width:50%;">
      <pre>
&lt;data&gt; 
  &lt;lookup&gt;
    &lt;values xml:id="id1"&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;one a&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;one b&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;one c&lt;/value&gt; 
    &lt;/values&gt;
    &lt;values xml:id="id2"&gt; 
      &lt;value&gt;two a&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;two b&lt;/value&gt; 
      &lt;value&gt;two c&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/values&gt; 
    &lt;values xml:id="id3"&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;three&lt;/value&gt; 
    &lt;/values&gt;
  &lt;/lookup&gt; 
  &lt;keys&gt; 
    &lt;key lookup="id1"&gt;first&lt;/key&gt; 
    &lt;key lookup="id2"&gt;second&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;key lookup="id3"&gt;third&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;/keys&gt; 
&lt;/data&gt;
      </pre>

      <p><small>Fig. 1. An XML snippet where there is a list of keys that via
      a reference (a so-called IDREF) in an attribute called lookup refer to
      nodes in another part of the document. The references are anchored using
      xml:id attributes. The relation between the keys and the values is one
      to many.</small></p>

      </div>


      <p>What is a brilliant feature in XSLT might not work at all in a GUI,
      so if you're a lover of the functional programming style recursive
      processing in XSLT you'll be disappointed. XForms isn't XML transformed
      into forms, it is language for writing GUIs for XML.</p>

      <p>Typically one can write really nifty GUIs in XForms. You'll find a
      lot of examples online, for instance by following links from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms">Wikipedia article</a>.  There
      are various implementations, server side ones as well as those running
      client side. I opted for the one implemented as a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/824">Firefox
      plug-in</a>.</p>

      <h3>Joins and XML documents</h3>

      <p>My project is about editing quite complicated documents, namely
      really heavy beasts in <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/innovation/mei/">Music Encoding
      Initiative XML</a>. We're building a MEI application while the inititive
      are revising the specification and, among other things, move from a DTD
      to <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RelaxNG</a>. A wise move.</p>

      <p>I might return to the project itself at a later stage, but here I
      want to tell you about XForms itself. And about joins. Consider the
      fragment in Fig. 1. If you want to be able to edit the values in the
      vicinity of the keys, you may need <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/aformwithajoin/a_form_with_a_join.xml">a
      form like this</a> (requires XForms in your browser). The essential code
      performing the join can be studied in Fig. 2.</p>

      <div>
	<pre>
      &lt;xf:group ref="instance('data-instance')/keys"&gt;
          &lt;xf:repeat nodeset="key"
        	  id="lookup-keys-loop"&gt;
               &lt;!-- do things with each key --&gt;
               &lt;xf:repeat 
                       nodeset="instance('data-instance')/lookup/
                       values[<span style="color:red;">@xml:id = current()/@lookup</span>]/value"
                       id="value-loop"&gt;
               &lt;!-- do things with value group --&gt;
               &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
          &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
       &lt;/xf:group&gt;
	</pre>

	<p style="margin-left:+5%;margin-right:+5%;"><small>Fig. 2. XForms
	snippet that loops around all key elements and for each of them make
	the lookup. That is, here we have the join in red colour. xf is short
	for the XForms namespace, which is http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms. Note
	that this code works inside a single document that looks like the one
	in Fig. 1. You cannot edit a database this way.</small></p>

      </div>


      <div style="float: left; width:50%;">
	 <pre>
   select
      last_name,
      department_name
   from
      employees e 
   left outer join 
      departments d
   on
      e.department_id=d.department_id;
	 </pre>

	 <p><small>Fig. 3. The SQL
	 equivalent to the XForms code in Fig. 2. The SQL assumes that there
	 is a table called employees and another called departments, and that
	 employees table contains department_id as a foreign key. This setup
	 is similar with the key-values (based on IDREF &amp; ID) arrangements
	 in Fig. 1-2.</small></p>

       </div>

       <p>The core is the XPath function <kbd style="font-family:courier;">current()</kbd> which returns the current
       context node. This construct can then be combined with input fields,
       text areas etc. The corresponding SQL code could look as in Fig. 3.</p>


       <h3>Get the last inserted ID</h3>

       <p><em><q>It's the same old story, but it's new to me.</q></em>
       Whenever you use a RDBMS, you'll sooner or later ask the question: Is
       there a way to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22get+the+last+inserted+id%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-m1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=">get
       the last inserted ID</a>? This, if any, is indeed a SQL FAQ.</p>

       <p>That is, you'll inserted a line in a table, and now you want to use
       this ID as a foreign key in another table. That is you want to create
       data that can be retrieved using a join. All SQL dialects and APIs
       provide facilities for this.</p>

       <p>Unfortunately, you don't have such functions in neither XForms nor
       XSLT. In XSLT that is no big deal; you <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/xslt_extensions/">can
       program anything</a> in that language. It is worse in XForms. Fig. 4
       shows shows an XForms trigger that executes a number of actions. It
       inserts two nodes, one containing an IDREF and the other the
       corresponding ID (like inserting both a department and an employee in
       the SQL setup in Fig. 3).</p>

       <p>The IDREF/ID values are created on the fly using XPath
       functions. The problem turned out to be to get hold of the value again
       for the second insert.</p>

       <div>
	 <pre>
&lt;xf:trigger&gt;
  &lt;xf:label&gt;Add key and value&lt;/xf:label&gt;
  &lt;xf:action ev:event="DOMActivate"&gt;
    &lt;xf:insert nodeset="key"
	 at="last()"
	 position="after" 
	 origin="instance('empty-instance')/keys/key"/&gt;
    &lt;xf:setvalue ev:event="DOMActivate"
	 ref="key[last()]/@lookup" 
	 value="concat('id',digest(string(random(true)), 'MD5', 'hex'))"/&gt;
    &lt;xf:insert nodeset="instance('data-instance')/lookup/values"
	 at="last()" 
	 position="after" 
	 origin="instance('empty-instance')/lookup/values"/&gt;
    &lt;xf:setvalue ev:event="DOMActivate"
	 ref="instance('data-instance')/lookup/values[last()]/@xml:id"
	 value="instance('data-instance')/keys/key[last()]/@lookup"/&gt;
  &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
	 </pre>
	 <p style="margin-left:+5%;margin-right:+5%;"><small>Fig. 4. XForms
	 code that inserts two elements in a document of the kind shown in
	 Fig. 1. The key element contains an IDREF (the attribute lookup)
	 which points the corresponding xml:id among the values. The form
	 operates by copying nodes from an empty instance and inserting them
	 into the data-instance, i.e., the instance being edited by the
	 user. The last setvalue contains the solution to the SQL FAQ:
	 <strong>How do I get the last inserted ID</strong></small></p>
       </div>

       <h3>Take home message</h3>

       <p>I've learned a lot of XForms and some new XPath functions. The code
       I needed in the Music Encoding initiative example was much more
       complicated than the trigger in Fig. 4.</p>

       <p>The very reason for writing this was that I used more than a week on
       this join and the corresponding ID/IDREF thing. I hadn't expected
       that complexity.</p>

       <p>But having been through this, I don't think there is any format that
       cannot be edited using XForms 1.1. It is a pity that virtually all text
       books and tutorials out there is XForms 1.0 and six or seven years
       old. This is a very good technology that deserves a breakthrough.</p>

  <title>Why you need a persistence strategy</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/youdontneed/"/>
  <summary>Here I go through some of the arguments why you need to implement a
  persistence strategy. We also conclude that the hypertext link is the single
  thing that makes the Worldwide web to a web. Hence it is a serious thing. If
  you're working within the digital library world you should be devoted to the
  hypertext link.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Alma Mater (the university that saw me mature from a teenager to a Ph
      D) has a web site. It used to implement a graphical profile which stated
      that all links should be listed at the end of a document. The
      documentation actually also claimed that hypertext links inside text
      bodies was poor usability. This is just plain bullshit. The hypertext
      link is the the single thing that makes the Worldwide web to a web. If
      some usability expert dislikes Wikipedia I bet it isn't because of all
      the hypertext links.</p>

      <p>Libraries have over the centuries provided experiences and
      information. Scholars have read and <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/quotations/">quoted the
      material we offer</a>. This has changed. <strong>Today the most
      important challenge for libraries today is to provide anchors for
      hypertext links.</strong></p>

      <p>Libraries who think that mission is accomplished when they've solved
      the problem of efficient document delivery belong to the past. You have
      to provide means for patrons to link to the arbitrary anchors in
      hypertexts, to polygons in images or time segments in video
      recordings.</p>

      <p>Document delivery is important. You cannot use documents unless they
      are delivered. Neither can you create arbitrary hypertext links into
      it. However, it is the fact that you are not done when your patron has
      the document in his or her browser which is the single most important
      reason why URN:NBN, DOI or HANDLEs are obsolete.</p>

      <p>It isn't you who should link to your documents. It is the library
      patrons who should do that. If they want to link to page five, they
      should be able to do so, and the link created should be as persistent as
      any German URN:NBN.</p>

      <p>And then. If you're not convinced:</p>

      <h3>1. I need PID to connect documents to archived copies</h3>

      <p>The problem is that people don't use PIDs in their texts, since they
      never see them. They follow links, are redirected by the resolver and
      link to what they get. When you remove your original hypertext anchor,
      many of your digital patrons links will rot.</p>

      <p>The truth is that you don't need to use PIDs for this. If you use
      HTTP as intended you redirect your users when moving documents to the
      archive. Users will never suffer. If you use PIDs they'll experience the
      404.</p>

      <h3>2. The DOI system is very good. It works</h3>

      <p>Yes, it works but it is not good. It is as bad as any other redirect
      based PID system. It works though, but that is because the consortium
      forces its members to care about links. That is very
      <strong>good</strong>, but the DOI system isn't.</p>

      <p>The truth is that you don't need DOIs for that. You need a link
      management policy.</p>

      <h3>3. PID's work when people change their domains. Cool URIs don't</h3>

      <p>Not really. Since people don't use PIDs in their documents, this
      doesn't help here either -- see point 1 above.</p>

      <p>The truth is that you should not change your domain. It is not
      regarded good practice among people who care about content. However, if
      you have to, use redirects (Moved permanently, status 301).</p>

      <p>If you have to change, keep the old one for a very long time. Someone
      may buy using your brand for selling porn or something else you don't
      approve.</p>

      <p>I'm one of those who try to base all decisions on facts. Politics
      belong to the strategic field, and in that field the only thing I can
      offer is advice.</p>

      <p>As a scientist and a software developer I've repeatedly considered
      the problems related to addressing on the Internet. I've written at
      length about <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2003/urnar_och_digitala_bibliotek">URNs
      and digital libraries</a> and <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/cooluris/">Cool
      URIs</a>. I'm going to continue to do that, because there are people in
      the library communities who just fail to understand that the URN stuff
      is a complete waste of time and money on something which is to little
      benefit and that may, in my view, be potentially harmful. Most recently
      it is the <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/wiki/display/persid/Partners">PersID
      project</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Please don't pull resources from scarce library budgets in
      support for an idea which died six or seven years ago!</strong></p>

      <h3>Single points of failure</h3>

      <p>The success of Internet is due to the fact that there are very few
      single points of failure. The same is true for the Worldwide web and the
      protocols that support it. The URN:NBN systems require HTTP based
      resolution services. <strong>That introduces such single points of
      failures.</strong></p>

      <h3>URN:NBN systems are lying</h3>

      <p>The <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>T</strong>ransfer <strong>P</strong>rotocol provide means for
      servers to inform software clients that a resource has been moved. This
      is called redirection and comes in two shapes: Moved permanently and
      Moved temporarily. The redirects should be used for exactly what the
      protocol says. Anything else is abuse of the intention of the
      protocol.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately redirects is the perhaps most abused part of the HTTP
      protocol, and URN:NBN resolvers and similar systems are the worst
      culprits. They are permanently sending temporary redirects. <strong>That
      is, they are lying.</strong></p>

      <h3>It is always best to tell the truth</h3>

      <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">
	What makes a cool URI?<br/>
	A cool URI is one which does not change.<br/>
	What sorts of URI change?<br/>
	<em>URIs don't change: people change them.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>wrote <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a> 1998. He knows what he's talking about, because he
      actually invented the Worldwide web.</p>

      <p>The take-home message of his essay is that if you have things you
      care of, you should assign URIs to them that are such that you will be
      able to maintain for years to come.</p>

      <p><strong>If you change the URI, then you don't care enough.</strong>
      And you have definitely not put enough intellectual effort into the
      dissemination of your resources. To put it another way: You have not
      considered the fact that your URI structure is a part your application
      and essential to the reusability of your date. To invent a special
      infrastructure, such as URN:NBN for this is to hide away these basic
      facts.</p>

      <h3>The interactive semantic web requires cool URIs</h3>

      <p>Things have changed a lot since 1998. It was only Tim Berners-Lee and
      others in the working groups of w3.org and IETF that could forsee Web
      2.0 and Web 3.0. You can recognize many of the pioneers from the fact
      that they usually claim that nothing has changed. And they're right,
      nothing technical has changed since 1998, other than that peoples
      understanding of what can be achieved using the web can do has gone from
      version 1.0 to 2.0 and is now on its way to version 3.0.</p>

      <p>Those who argue that we should go for URN:NBN have not understood.</p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, I'd say that they never understood the release
      version 0.9. I'm sorry.</p>

      <p><strong>In the web of data, the aspects of a resource that are worth
      persistent identification is in the hand of its users, since it is the
      users who do the linking.</strong></p>

      <p>Why on earth should we assign a URN:NBN to Romeo &amp; Juliet, if the
      users want to quote the balcony scene?</p>

      <p>Why on earth should you assign a URN:NBN to an article, when I want
      to address Figure 3?</p>

      <p>User annotation need a persistent annotation anchor, and that could
      be a part of an image.</p>

      <p>Yes, we need persistence. But please, not technology advised by
      people who never understood web 0.9</p>

  <title>The proliferation of redundant meaning</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/semanticdrift/"/>
  <summary>I first used the term semantic drift about 10 years ago. It was a
  real danger then, it still is but the proliferation of synonymous
  vocabularies is worse still.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <div style="float:left;width:60%;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/semanticdrift/graph.png">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/02/semanticdrift/graph.png" style="width:100%;" alt="frequency occurrences of the term 'semantic drift'"/>
	</a>
	<p><small>Fig. 1. The usage of the term <q>semantic drift</q> in web
	documents. Note the logarithmic scale on the Y-axis: There is a
	tenfold increase between 2007 and 2008. By the first of January 2010
	there had appeared 19600. These use of the term in the context of
	semantic web is not very common. For instance, <q>semantic drift</q>
	and <q>semantic web</q> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22semantic+drift%22+%22semantic+web%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=">827
	hits</a> whereas the latter on its own yields more than three
	millions hits.</small></p>

	<p><small>The increase in popularity occurs in bursts. It seems to me
	that the term get a new meaning in each burst, but I've only looked at
	a small number of texts.</small></p>

      </div>

      <p>You hear a term, and you may think that it sounds cool and therefore
      you import it into your active vocabulary. About ten or twelve years ago
      <q>semantic drift</q> was such a term for me. <q>Semantic change, also
      known as semantic shift or semantic progression describes the evolution
      of word usage</q> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_drift">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

      <p>I'm an evolutionary biologist by training, for me <em>genetic</em>
      drift and evolution through natural (Darwinian) selection have
      <em>two</em> different meanings -- drift is the evolution which is due
      to random change which arise, mainly but not exclusively, through
      mutation between <em>synonymous</em> genes -- they differ but the effect
      is the same.</p>

      <p>I used the term <q>semantic drift</q> <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Oct/0121.html">publicly
      year 2000</a>. I used it for a couple of years, but I don't think I've
      used it since 2003. The term has since then gained some popularity in
      many communities (see Fig. 1). From what I've found out, the term first
      appeared in a metadata or semantic web context in an <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/July95/07weibel.html">article by Stuart
      Weibel 1995</a>.</p>

	<p><small>Fig. 2. The so-called dumb down principle. The only way to
	cope with the semantic diversity.</small></p>
      </div>

      <p>The discussion I adhere to above (the hitherto only documented
      occation where I mention semantic drift) was on w3.org's RDF mailing
      list, and was about the meaning of the metadata element title. More
      precisely, we were discussing what it meant that the DC title changed
      name space URI between version 1.0 (<a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/title">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/title</a>)
      and version 1.1, (i.e., <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title</a>)?</p>

      <p>There was a reader of DCMI documents who didn't understand why we did
      that change. In retrospect I think we didn't understand that either
      ourselves. We had made a mistake and we couldn't really acknowledge
      that.</p>

      <p>This is the history behind the version number 1.1 in DC. At the time
      I presented a study of meta-tags in around 5 million HTML documents
      during my life as search engineer <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2000/delft/examples/metadata_statistics.html">1996-2000</a>. This
      was the time when I felt the need for Fig. 2. I drew it for illustrating
      what I was doing when I was handling metadata. The reason for using dumb
      down is that even if your service you're building is equipped with an
      advanced search form, you won't be able to sell it to a customer who
      claim that usability is important if it contains more than around ten
      fields.</p>

      <p>I have recently been thinking about these issues, frightened by
      dbpedia.org's vocabularies. See for instance <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/August_Strindberg">August Strindberg's
      entry</a>. <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Inferno_(Strindberg_novel)">Inferno</a> is
      one of his works. From what I can tell, dbpedia.org is mainly using
      their own vocabularies, and <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">foaf</a>. I cannot find dc:creator as
      a property of Inferno, instead they use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/author">dbpedia-owl:author</a>. I hope
      they had a nice time defining their ontologies. I, however, feel
      that I need my funnel (Fig. 2) more than ever.</p>

  <summary>My attitude towards eBooks has always been negative. Why should we lock content into proprietary formats. The sitution has changed.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Three reflexions inspired by the three</p>

      <h3>I</h3>

      <p>Adobe has grown from being the owner of postscript and the electronic
      font foundry of the 1990's. It is still going strong on the traditional
      markets but have a lot of inpact on just about anything related to media
      consumption and production.</p>

      <p>Apple don't support flash. Apple don't support the *.epub copy
      protection promoted by Adobe.</p>

      <div style="float: left;width:70%;text-align:center;">

      <p><small>Fig. 1. The search interest for "tablet pc" in Google. It has
      been declining until very recently :-)</small></p>
      </div>

      <h3>II</h3>

      <p>Amazon thinks that eBooks should be cheap, say $9.99. Just as Apple
      thinks that 99 cent is OK for a track. Publishers in general and
      MacMillan in particular doesn't like that and suggests $14.99.</p>

      <p>Apple likes that.</p> 

      <p>Torrent users doesn't like that.</p> 

      <h3>III</h3>

      <p>I don't think that iPad will have any effect on eBook prices in the
      long run. However, the tablet PC will, finally, gain in popularity. And
      so will eBooks.</p>

      <p>The eBooks will make 40 year old books a commercial asset, which will further
      decrease the libraries market share.</p>

  <summary>Is Internet at a crossroad?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>An earlier version of this entry had the title: <em>Social media,
      Google adwords and the curation of digital refuse</em>. However, it
      would be misleading call this document a version of the text I planned
      to write.</p>

      <p>I just couldn't get the various threads in place and write a single
      text with a neat take home message. Instead, the result is a relatively
      shallow annotated URIography, rather than a deep analysis of some
      current trends in the evolution of the Internet and the western
      societies. Sorry.</p>
      
      <h3>Power Sites</h3>

      <p>A site which <q cite="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/19/Power-Web-Site">is
      designed as the primary Web property for a person, place, or thing is a
      power site</q>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/19/Power-Web-Site">says
      Tim Bray</a>, <q>if the person, place, or thing has a Wikipedia entry
      but, in popular search engines, the site ranks above that Wikipedia
      entry.</q></p>

      <p>Tim Bray's own blog is a power site, my stuff isn't. I have no
      Wikipedia entry ;-). Power sites are assets these days, if you put
      adverts on the, that is.</p>


      <h3>Power Universities and Researchers</h3>

      <p>Lorcan Dempsey, whose blog is also a Power Site, discusses a number
      of social technology sites <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/002011.html">for research
      information</a>, complete with friends and ranking etc.</p>

      <p>I <strong>like</strong> facebook for scientific papers. Do you
      <strong>like</strong> too?.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/">Ouseful blog</a>
      discusses <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2010/02/13/virtual-revolution-google-economics/">google
      economics and page ranks</a>, while <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408908&amp;navcode=105">The
      Times Higher Education</a> has ranked universities for years. That is a
      not enough, obviously, since <a href="http://science.thomsonreuters.com/globalprofilesproject/gpp-opinion/">Thomson
      Reuters</a> and <a href="http://informatics.indiana.edu/scholmet09/announcement.html">NSF
      follow suit.</a>.</p>

      <h3>Content farming</h3>

      <p>During the year 2009 we saw the advent of the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/content_farms_impact.php">content
      farms</a>. It is fairly easy to rapidly aggregate content by archiving
      mailing lists, RSS feeds etc. Adding Google Ads you get a business model
      as well. There's good reason to be worried, in particular for Google. A
      few other voices:

      <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_google_can_combat_content_farms.php">Combat
      content farms</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/13/the-end-of-hand-crafted-content/">The
      rise of fast food content is upon us, and it’s going to get ugly</a> and
      <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2009/12/14/content-farms-v-curating-farmers/">curating
      farmers</a>.</p>

      <h3>Books and parasites</h3>

      <p>To my knowledge, Jacob Nielsen was the first to describe the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search_engines.html">parasitic
      nature of the search engine's business model</a>. The dilemma is that
      without the search engine, noone would find your pages and with the
      search engine noone will click on ads on your pages. More recently there
      has been discussions on how people will be able to survive as
      journalists and authors on a market where content farms and real news
      sites generate about as much revenue. See Charles Stross' <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/the-monetization-paradox-or-wh.html">The

      <h3>Pointless babble</h3>

      <p>Tim O'Reilly &amp; Sarah Milstein have written <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596802820">The Twitter Book</a>. I
      haven't read it, but then I have to confess I'm no Twitter Power
      user. I'm not even a user.</p>

      <p>Bill Heil and Mikolaj Piskorski <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2009/06/new_twitter_research_men_follo.html">describe
      recent results from their research on Twitter</a>. They are really
      interesting and some of them are surprising, such as that the top 10% of
      prolific Twitter users accounted for over 90% of the tweets. These
      numbers are very much more aggregated than for social internet sites in
      general, where the top 10% accounts for about 30% of the activity. The
      same study shows that men follows men to a very large extent, and also
      that woman follows men more than other women but that they are more
      <q>equal</q> in their preferences. (see also <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2009/06/twitter_hype_or.html">twitter
      hype or</a>, businessweek.com).</p>

      <p>One study shows that many <q>people still perceive Twitter as just
      mindless babble of people telling you what they are doing
      minute-by-minute</q> and that the tweets is written in <q>self-promotion
      with very few folks actually paying attention</q> (<a href="http://www.pearanalytics.com/blog/2009/twitter-study-reveals-interesting-results-40-percent-pointless-babble/">Pointless babble</a>)</p>

      <h3>There is a single theme</h3>

      <p>I feel that there is a single theme in all this. There are problems
      here. There are needs for business models and new methods for
      monetization. We need that as well, we in the library business. Perhaps
      a public service model could make a difference?</p>

  <title>Reflections on a Library at Dusk</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/01/dusk/"/>
  <summary>During my soon five years at The Royal Library, I've seen its
  exterior in all kinds of weather conditions. Here I give you some images
  showing the spectacular black granite fasade at dusk.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <div style="margin: 0.5em; float: left; width:40%;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200908-200912/smaller/20091201108.jpg" border="0" title="library at dusk">

	</a>
      </div>

      <p>This is The Royal Library, Copenhagen, also known as The Black
      Diamond.  I've seen its exterior in all kinds of weather conditions
      during the five years I've been working there. I'll give you some images
      showing the spectacular black granite fasade at dusk.</p>

      <p>I have taken all of them with my mobile, from the stop of bus
      66. While waiting for the bus, I can see the library if I turn towards
      the east. Towards the south I can see the harbour, which is a strait
      separating the island of Amager from Copenhagen. Here you'll recognize
      the reflections of the water in the harbour. You can also see the
      Langebro bridge and the large Ny Kredit building. These are structures
      situated west from the library, behind my back.</p>

      <div style="margin: 0.5em; float: right; width:40%;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/01/dusk/20100120204.jpg" title="rush hour reflected in a library">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/01/dusk/20100120204.jpg" width="100%" alt="rush hour reflected in a library"/>
	</a>
      </div>

      <p>There is a red dot in the black granite. It is the reflections of the
      back light of a car driving westwards from the bus stop towards the
      bridge. If you look really careful you'll see a green traffic light
      mirror itself close the the red dot.</p>

      <div style="margin: 0.5em; float: left; width:40%;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200908-200912/smaller/20091130106.jpg" border="0" title="library under the rainbow">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200908-200912/smaller/20091130106.jpg" width="100%" alt="library under the rainbow"/>
	</a>
      </div>


      <p>I've been really fascinated by these reflections for some time
      now. Here is another image which is cropped to show the traffic. There
      is red traffic lights just outside the library, and green at the
      Langebro bridge. You can see a distinct green dot in the black
      granite. There's quite a few eastbound cars taking the opportunity to
      mirror themselves in the black granite while waiting.</p>

      <h2>Somewhere under the rainbow</h2>

      <p>A classical rainbow contains most visible colours. This one, however,
      is taken at dusk. Hence there is more red in it than you're used to. To
      be honest, this image is taken east of the bus stop. You see, I had to
      position myself such that the pot of gold should be found by Our
      Saviour's Church. If you look carefully, you should be able to see the
      tip of its cork screw shaped tower just where the rain bow hits the
      ground.</p>

  <title>On being an international commuter</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/"/>
  <summary>The last four years I've spent more than two hours a day on
  trains. And usually, but not always less than three. Furthermore, I go from
  one nation to another and participate in the in the digital dissemination of
  cultural heritage of a country which isn't my own.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">


      <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/102-0039s.jpg" style="margin-left:0.5em;float:right;margin-right:0.5em; width:50%" alt="Sigfrid Lundberg as an international commuter"/>

      <p>[Update: My friend and former colleague <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/Tomas_and_Sigfrid.shtml">Tomas</a>
      took a day off from his work at Lund university and went to
      Copenhagen. Tomas is documenting just about everything he does, and
      here's his documentation of me as an international commuter.]</p>

      <p>In both Lund and Copenhagen there are a lot of people riding
      bicycles. They behave very differently, however, and their spatial
      distribution is different. In Copenhagen the riders have a much more
      aggregated distribution. They ride at high speed in squadrons, somewhat
      like Mongolian cavalry. Before their mounted assaults on the pedestrians
      on H.C. Andersens Boulevard, their prime target, the Copenhagen bicycle
      riders congregate at any of the many traffic lights in the area.</p>

      <p>In Lund, where the traffic lights are more scarce, there are few
      natural meeting points. Hence, bicycle riders in Lund are forced to
      operate in much smaller units, or even solitarily. Great speed and
      bravery is nevertheless needed, as Lund's bicycle riders are well known
      for their suicidal attacks upon much larger four-wheeled vehicles.</p>

      <p>Normally I leave home and mount my bike ten past seven in the
      morning. That gives me ample time to patrol the area between my home and
      the railway station before I have to catch the 07.39 train from Lund to
      Copenhagen. That trip is uneventful, except for occasional encounters
      with an increasing number of power walking young ladies. The power
      walkers stride along in a frenzy, their eyes fixed on a point far
      way. Neither their faces nor their eyes reveal any emotion whatsoever.
      They don't seem to like walking. I think that they are all in a
      hurry home for a shower and a nice slow breakfast.</p>

      <p>I haven't yet seen any power walkers striding along H.C. Andersens
      Boulevard or elsewhere in central Copenhagen, but I reckon it is due to
      the successful operations of the bicycle riders.</p>

      <h2>A parking place</h2>

      <img src="http://www.sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200907-200907/smaller/cimg1352.jpg" style="margin-left:0.5em;float:left;margin-right:0.5em;" alt="Secure locking is essential"/>

      <p>I have one serious problem. That is to find a secure parking place
      for my bike at the railway station. A lot of people who park there have
      lost their vehicles. There are stories about thieves coming there with
      lorries, bringing loads of bicycles for export to Poland. I've recently
      acquired a new bike, since my previous one was stolen. Apart from
      finding a parking place, the temporal bottle-neck is to lock the
      thing. I've got two really solid locks, and try to park where I can use
      one of them for locking the bike to the iron structure provided by the
      local council for the benefit for of paranoid bicycle owners (see the
      image).</p>

      <p>I've been told that bicycle theft is very common in Copenhagen. And
      that the shortage of parking places is a real problem as well, in
      particular around the Central Station. I take the bus, or walk carefully
      avoiding HC Andersen's Boulevard.</p>

      <h2>Two cultures</h2>

      <p>Swedes &amp; Danes are cousins. Both tribes are viking
      grandchildren. So are off course the Icelanders and Norwegians, but it
      is only the Icelanders who have kept their old language. The rest of us
      has diverged, but still there has been some force that has kept us
      together linguistically as well as culturally. I've been told that
      people from Algeria cannot talk to people from Egypt, in spite of the
      fact that they all speak Arabic. Now, I speak Swedish and my colleagues
      all speak Danish. And we can all laugh at a good joke.</p>

      <p>I won't say that language doesn't pose any problems, but none I can't
      live with. Collaborative writing is a problem, though. My Danish is a
      joke, like the speech of the Swedish chef in the Muppet
      show. Collaborative writing is worst, since that forces colleagues to
      translate my gibberish. I usually write documentation in English, and
      everything else in Swedish. Both will be understood.</p>

      <p>Many Danes think that Swedes are formal, moralistic and more prone to
      bureaucracy than Danes. This is because in Sweden everything that make
      life worth living, such as tobacco, alcohol and visiting prostitutes,
      are either prohibited, restricted or somehow controlled by the
      government. More recently, some Danes have been accusing us for being
      afflicted by some unhealthy psychological disorder making us inclined to
      deny any problems concerning immigration and integration. I cannot
      understand why; just wait a year and we will also have a solid racist
      representation in our parliament, as in Denmark.</p>

      <p>Many Swedes who have little personal experience of Denmark actually
      believe that everything that makes life worth-while is more free in
      Denmark and that it is a much more cosy place. All Swedish commuters
      I've talked to about the cultural differences between Danes and Swedes
      tell a story which is quite the opposite from the Danish self image. The
      amount of bureaucracy is less in Sweden and the Danish society is more
      hierarchical. On the other hand, I think it is true that we Swedes are a
      moralistic lot, at least when it comes to life in Denmark.</p>

      <p>One thing that surprises me is our ever ongoing discussions on
      responsibility. People here say "this is not our job" more often than in
      Sweden. Delegation of responsibilities is more widespread in Sweden than
      in Denmark. As a consequence leaders in Denmark are extremely busy. We
      also have an endless number of committees in Denmark, which I think is a
      surrogate for responsible people. That is, when no individual takes
      responsibility, it has to unwillingly be shared by committees.</p>

      <h2>A slightly more endless number of shorter meetings</h2>

      <p>When I started my work, the Danish meeting culture was a relief. In
      both countries there will be an agenda for a meeting. The difference is
      that in Denmark we allocate a fixed amount of time, and the meeting ends
      regardless whether we've been through the agenda or not. It felt as if I
      had finally escaped from the country of endless meetings. Indeed I
      had. I had come to the country of an endless number of meetings.</p>

      <p>When I think of it, the number of meetings seemed endless in Sweden
      too, but the number of meetings is more endless in Denmark.</p>

      <p>If the Vatican had been situated in Copenhagen, I doubt that they had
      ever been able to elect a new pope. The College of Cardinals would
      declare that the meeting is over before they reached that point on the
      agenda. It is, sometimes, an advantage to lock in committees and tell
      them that they'll get lunch when they completed their task.</p>

      <p>After seven hours and twenty-four minutes I'm free to return to my
      home country, half an hour for lunch included. In Sweden we work eight
      hours, and that excludes half an hour for lunch. And if you're in a
      meeting you'll almost certainly miss it anyway.</p>

      <h2>Then comes the afternoon</h2>

      <img src="http://www.sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200907-200907/smaller/cimg1348.jpg" style="margin-left:0.5em;float:right;margin-right:0.5em;" alt="Secure locking is essential"/>

      <p>In the afternoon I take the train back home. I embark the train and
      sit there reading something, or possibly writing texts like this one. I
      sit there passively being transported. Then I disembark. All of a sudden
      I'm standing on a platform at Lund Central, having the strange feeling
      that I cannot recall what happened on the train. I cannot even recall
      what I thought about while on the train. This frightens me. "I Think
      Therefore I Exist", Descartes wrote. The central question for me in my
      life as a commuter is: Do I really exist while I'm on the train.</p>

      <p>Ordinary people exist twenty-four hours a day. It's a gift. Is this
      true for us commuters? I doubt that this is so. I suppose that we
      commuters live, on the average, as long as other people when the length
      of our lives is measured in years, but much less if we measure longevity
      in hours.</p>

      <p>When I return to my bike I usually find that some other bicycle
      riders have lent their bikes on mine, and usually artfully intertwined
      their handlebars with the wires of my handlebar gear and brake (see
      image). It is a nuisance, but I regard it as a helpful defense measure
      against bicycle theft. I thank my fellow bicycle riders and again unlock
      my two solid locks. I don't envy those who commute to Lund from
      elsewhere keeping a bike at Lund Central in order to save time --
      they'll arrive late to their meetings and miss their their lunches.</p>

      <p>In the evening I again patrol the area between Lund Central and my
      home. The trip is as uneventful as the one in the morning, but the power
      walking young ladies has been replaced by much older female dog owners,
      strolling leisurely through the city on their way towards the parks. I
      suppose power walkers don't like dogs.</p>

  <title>Fifteen polar bears and one architecture</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/11/kbmetadta/"/>
  <summary>Today I gave a presentation on our metadata work. My experience of
  that turned out to be about images.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Today I gave a presentation on our metadata work. It was meant to be
      about METS and MODS, but it became more of a justification for our work
      than about. As usual I had <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2009/nov30/presentation.xml">too many
      slides</a>. My main idea was to use google images instead of slides, but
      then I had to add some slides anyway because the navigation overhead was
      too high and I had difficulties to remember which images to click on.</p>

      <p>The google searches are interesting. The visual result sets give you
      an overview very different from the text search. The visual search
      engines (see, for example <a href="http://www.search-cube.com/">Search
      Cube</a>) base their navigation on some kind of canned screen dumps.
      That's nice but it isn't the images produced by the author, but an image
      of the text.</p>

      <p>Please find below an annotated list of links to searches I like:</p>

      <p>First hit is Figure 1, from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">the appropriate W3
      recommendation</a>. Then there are fifteen polar bears belonging to the
      cover of <q>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</q>, a title
      that I think I should read when I get the opportunity.</p>

      <h2><a href="http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=1&amp;q=library+catalog&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1&amp;start=0">Library
      catalog</a></h2>

      <p>This one isn't as spectacular as the architecture, but it
      gives you an idea on what people know and believe they know when it
      comes to what libraries and cataloging is about.</p>

      <div style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">

      <p>There is a wonderful image (Figure 2) showing what we were all
      thinking about around 2006. When I think of it, we still are. The range
      of protocols to support, and the list of metadata formats are the
      same. The ideas doesn't change that fast.</p>

      <p>All libraries I know have a circulation desk. Searching for it in
      Google images yields 978000 hits. Adding quotation marks reduces the
      number to 34400. None of them are particularly interesting, except
      perhaps the one at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/army_arch/2691906687/">Doheny
      Library</a>.</p>

      <p>My fascination is more due to fact that they are all there, all these
      desks. I mean, how interesting is a circulation desk?</p>

      <p>This one hard core information science. <em>Work</em> is the

  <summary>Through the web, a software vendor and a service provider could all

      developer</em> and my trade as <em>digital libraries</em>. These areas
      are no exception.</p>

      <p>Like many web developers I spend a better part of my day on coding
      and other activities related to software development. But so do people
      involved in non-linear oscillation simulators. The web is an
      <em>application area</em>, but like non-linear systems it is also an
      area of research on its own right, and so is digital library
      research.</p>

      <p>There is more to digital libraries than just software
      development. There are all research concerning resource description, and
      how it relates to usability. There are also extensive standardization
      work going on. Now, how much digital library knowledge would a
      programmer need to know in order to build a good service?</p>

      <h2>The specification and the TODO-list</h2>

      <p>In theory nothing. If the specification is good enough, then the
      product should be good enough and this could, again in theory, ensured
      by unit tests.</p>

      <p>The problems here are, first, the quality of the specification, and,
      secondly, the <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/11/twocultures/">Two
      Cultures</a> (developers and editorial staff do not always understand
      each other).  The two problems are related to each other.</p>

      <p>The specification is a part of the agreement between the programmer
      and his or her customer. The work is completed when everything in the
      spec is in place. Programmer's need to know when they can send the
      bill.</p>

      <p>We who write software, we're a kind of mathematical people. We will
      feel secure if we know that the axioms are in place, that the theorems
      are there as well, and that the deductions are correct.</p>

      <p>For instance, if a piece of software is intended to assist an
      aircraft both at take-off and landing, then the specification should say
      so. Even if we thus kind of state the obvious, or if could imagine that
      there is no space in the sky for all planes that wouldn't be able to
      land.</p>

      <h2>The web and software as services</h2>

      <p>The web changed this. Not entirely but to a very large
      extent. There's a fundamental difference between being a vendor and
      being a service provider. The service provider try to get more users all
      the time which calls for continuous development.</p>

      <p>Through the web, a software vendor and a service provider could all
      of a sudden compete on the same market. The software vendor use the
      traditional specification, but a service implies software which is in
      continuous development. Strictly speaking, there are no projects
      anymore, just different activities. No specifications anymore, but TODO
      lists containing incidents, bugs and requests for features ranked by
      importance.</p>

      <p>And there is a continuous need for innovation.</p>

  <summary>Do you know the second law of thermodynamics?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p> C.P. Snow quoted G.H. Hardy</p>

      <blockquote style="font-style:italic;font-size:98%;">
	<p>“I remember G. H. Hardy once remarking to me in mild puzzlement,
	some time in the 1930s, Have you noticed how the word "intellectual"
	is used nowadays? There seems to be a new definition which certainly
	doesn't include Rutherford or Eddington or Dirac or Adrian or me? It
	does seem rather odd, don't y'know. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures#C._P._Snow_quotations">C. P. Snow</a>)”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>in his book <em>The Two Cultures</em>. Another one:</p>

      <blockquote style="font-style:italic;font-size:98%;">
	<p>“A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who,
	by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly
	educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their
	incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists.”</p>

	<p>“Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how
	many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The
	response was cold: it was also negative.”</p>

	<p>“Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of:
	Have you read a work of Shakespeare’s?”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>C.P. Snows book appeared <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V129/N26/shu.html">fifty years</a> ago. I've
      studied science and technology for a better part of my life, and I've no
      idea how many times I've got remarks like “that's a technical
      detail.” It has happened this year.</p>

      <p>Do you know what a markup language is? You may, or may not know the
      answer, but I suppose it's still more important to read Shakespeare if
      you're to be regarded as an educated person.</p>

      <p>I do know the laws of thermodynamics, and I've read more than one
      work by Shakespeare. However, we software developers usually don't write
      like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(programming_language)">Shakespeare</a>. We
      may be good hackers anyway.</p>

  <title>What about the HECS platforms?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/10/webdevelopment/"/>
  <summary>I've used fortran, pascal, C, perl, php and java in addition to
  more specialized tools such as SQL and XSLT. There is currently a lot of
  discussions on what platform will be the next winner.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Anyone who has stayed in the same business for some years, have seen
      the recurrent changes in fashion. You'll also experience how people try
      to sell you the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_black_dress">little black
      dress</a> as something new. People invent a lot of things. Some of them
      are not that innovative. Some ideas required further development before
      they could take off. Some ideas were right, but the time wasn't.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/10/14/OOW-Take-aways#p-2">legacy</a>
      is something that is accumululating behind you. What someone (usually
      someone else) acquired or developed. You don't like the legacy, in
      particular not its documentation, but you have to maintain it.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time just about every script on the internet was written
      in the PERL programming language. Then just about every introductory
      programming course choose java as the prime example of an OO
      language. Just about any project should have some object oriented
      modelling, and J2EE was the name of the game. There were noone available
      for the legacy.</p>

      <h2>The HECS platforms</h2>

      <p>Then things happen again. PHP had been there all along. Many of the
      largest sites hade been using it for years for front-end work. The
      back-end could be written in JAVA but C, C++, perl and python are
      used. For newer sites there are languages like <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, H and E in HECS. The remaining
      characters are C as in <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and S
      for <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></p>

      <p>Mankind is stratified into those who are early adopters and those
      that are more hesitant. Some of the early adopters buy the little black
      dress over and over again. In a sense I belong to the hesitant ones;
      novelty per se does not add to my interest. On the other hand I can get
      very enthusiastic to learn about ideas and technologies that I find
      elegant and new <em>to me</em>. One such idea, which is a true design
      classic, is functional programming. It isn't strictly speaking new to
      me. I've studied the Scheme programming language, and I'm using
      XSLT and Xquery.</p>

      <p>I'm very impressed by the elegance of the Haskell programming
      language, and the community that has been built around it. <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> is Haskell's answer to
      PERL's <a href="http://cpan.org/">cpan</a>, PHP's <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> and Python's <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a>. The Haskell developers
      seems to be most advanced when it comes to building an open-source
      community. I do believe that Erlang is the platform which has the best
      track record; it has been used in Ericsson's Open Telecom Platform, for
      building ATM switches, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">couchDB</a>
      -- a modern cloud computing classic.</p>

      <p>Still, I'm going for Haskell. I want a language which isn't using any
      virtual machine. The <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Referential_transparency">referential
      transparency</a> (purity) is just a wonderful idea. I want something
      really new and elegant, such as a little black dress.</p>

  <title>Aggravated autumn depression</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/10/nicotine/"/>
  <summary>I've felt miserable for a month, at least. Here is the
  explanation...</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>The last few weeks I've not felt as good as I used to. As a matter of
      fact I've been really miserable.</p>

      <p>It started in August. You see, when I am about to complete any
      substantial <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/">piece of
      work or project</a>, I looked forward to the delivery with certain level
      of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_disorder">separation
      anxiety</a>. And then, after all deliverables are completed and a new
      <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/">service
      is in place</a>, I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">postpartum
      depression</a>.</p>

      <p>This autumn all this was aggravated by severe <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000953.htm">nicotine
      withdrawal</a> symptoms. I'd say, don't even try giving up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7ljAYX6kE">wet snuff</a>, unless
      you've prepared yourself for a passage through hell.</p>

  <title>Syndication and Simple REST XML web services in a library context</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/"/>
  <summary>Some time ago I demonstrated our navigation services. In that entry
  I promised to tell you more about these services when they are are more
  mature. Here is the story on the architecture of some of our new
  digitization services.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Some time ago I discussed our architecture for <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/">presenting some
      of our digitized material</a>. We use a combination of <a href="http://www.opml.org/">opml</a> and <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> for letting our users
      search and navigate our <a href="http://www.kb.dk/editions/any/2009/jul/editions/en/">Digital
      Editions</a>.  Opml is used for dissemination of the subject structure
      and for hierarchical tables of contents. Result set navigation is using
      open search. The system could be described as having two major
      architectural components, the database layer (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>) and the presentation layer (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

      <div style="float: left; width: 70%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;" id="fig1">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/architecture.png">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/architecture.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 1." border="0"/>
	</a>
	<p>
	  <small>Fig. 1. Database layer. The export controller pulls data out
	  of our Cumulous Digital Asset Management system, normalizes them to
	  a single syntactical and semantical system, namely <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">Metadata Object
	  Description Schema (MODS)</a>. From that format it is further
	  transformed into RSS 2.0 and Dublin Core. Finally these metadata
	  objects are stored in our Oracle as XML fragments.</small>

	  <small>The normalization rules are implemented as a set of XSLT
	  scripts with a supporting set of xpath functions implemented in
	  java.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Metadata processing</h2>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I accidentally searched the Web for "metadata
      processing". "Google suggest" invites you to that kind of
      serendipity. I've previously not been able to give a name to the
      discipline of one of my main areas of expertise; here we go. It's
      metadata processing. This phrase yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22metadata+processing%22&amp;btnG=Search">about
      10.600 hits</a> in a Google search, which makes it a smaller disciplin
      than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22sewage+processing%22&amp;btnG=Search">sewage
      processing</a>.</p>

      <p>The database layer is all about metadata processing. Our <a href="http://www.canto.com/">Cumulus</a> installation contains a
      multitude of metadata fields invented by people for particular purposes
      in the past. The main objective has been to get a job done and images
      into a database, not out on the web in an efficient way and not to get
      the metadata across to other services.</p>


      <div style="float: right; width: 60%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;" id="fig2">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/architecture2.png">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/architecture2.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 2." border="0"/>
	</a>
	<p>
	  <small>Fig. 2. Presentation layer. The presentation layer is really
	  two layers, one Web service layer and one user step further away a
	  graphical user interface which we refer to as an OpenSearch
	  gateway. This is because OpenSearch is its main communication
	  protocol with the web service layer.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>In this project our goal was to be able to present this material in a
      single framework, using a homogenous metadata profile. The metadata core
      is built around Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS). The Export
      controller (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>) consists of two loosely
      connected components; the Exporter and the Digester. The former
      basically dumps data from Cumulus using its <a href="http://www.canto.com/en/docs/documentation/PDF_JCR_ReadMe_750_Z.pdf">java
      API</a>, the latter basically transforms those data into a range of XML
      fragment formats described in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.</p>

      <p>The basic idea is to avoid any stage where we have to generate XML
      from scratch later on in the process; processing of semi-manufactured
      XML objects is computationally much cheaper than the generation of new
      ones.</p>

      <h2>Web services</h2>

      <p>The web service layer (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) does search and
      retrieval and operates basically by retrieving the XML fragments
      generated by the Digester (see above). The design goal has been to
      minimize the cost of XML processing here to a minimum. For the
      processing that occur there we use the <a href="http://stax.codehaus.org/Home">Streaming API for XML (StAX)</a>
      (JSR-173). StAX is standard from java sdk 1.6. It wasn't trivial to get
      it running for java 5.</p>

      <p>When you just want to make modest stream editing of XML,
      this is an excellent tool. I doubt that you can ever get an as fast DOM
      based XML tool, so whenever possible use this. There are a few cases
      where we were forced to introduced XML and XSLT for more extensive
      editing, but in general here we use ligh-weight XML technology. We
      access Oracle through <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>,
      which was a pleasure when the mappings were in place -- but it is a
      nightmare to make the hibernate mappings if you're a beginner.</p>

      <p>OpenSearch is my favourate XML protocol for searching, since it is
      much easier to use than <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/">SRU</a>.  You can direct test
      an OpenSearch implementation on <a href="http://www.a9.com/-/opensearch/">on a9.com</a>. You paste the URI
      of an opensearch description into their form and you'll then get back an
      interpretation of your data and a search form. <a href="http://www.a9.com/-/opensearch/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kb.dk%2Fcop%2Fdescription%2Fimages%2Fbilled%2F2008%2Fsep%2Fkistebilleder&amp;x=39&amp;y=11">Please
      try it!</a>. Don't search for the suggested search term esbjerg, try
      something like "Adam".</p>

      <p>The OAI service is already running, and for the first time our
      library catalog can retrieve and import bibliographical records from our
      digitization services automatically.</p>

      <h2>Presentation layer</h2>

      <p>The part of the system which users will actually see and use is best
      described as a mash-up engine. The basis is yet-another template
      system. I think that it is fair guess that each major web development
      platform already has more of those than they need. My problem was that I
      needed a recursive one.</p>

      <p>The template is a XML document with include statements in certain
      places. The engine then retrieves data from the web services, transform
      the them and put the product in place with the XML DOM api. There will
      now be new include statements, which were the product of the previous
      set of data inserted. There are usually a handful of recursions before
      the page is ready for delivery. We have two skins or templates running,
      <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a>
      and Default used for the services mentioned above. Apart from different
      look and feel, Danmarksbilleder uses an older version of the database
      and another set of web services. See my previous <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/">posting</a>.</p>

      <p>There are currently no plans to make new HTML skins. However, I'm
      about to write one that generates Metadata Encoding and Transmission
      Standard (METS) documents. But that's another story.</p>

  <title>Att tjäna den demokratiska kulturnationens minne</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/09/msb/"/>
  <summary>Jag har arbetat med att programmera digitala bibliotek i ungefär 15
  år. När jag läser debatten om biblioteket i Sydsvenskan känner jag att jag
  borde säga något. Jag vet inte i vilken utsträckning mitt perspektiv kommer
  att kännas relevant för alla de som känner sig kallade att yttra sig, men
  jag har en hel del erfarenheter som nog de flesta andra saknar.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Det har varit en lång debatt om vad biblioteket är till för i
      Sydsvenskan, nu senast av Per Svensson: <a href="http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article551225/Viva-Las-Vegas.html">Viva
      Läs Vegas</a>. Här kommer min version av varför jag tycker vi behöver
      bibliotek.</p>

      <p>Biblioteket bygger på två principer. När jag säger biblioteket menar
      jag inget särskilt bibliotek, vare sig Library of Congress, Umberto Ecos
      klosterbibliotek i <q>Rosens namn</q> eller för den delen Malmö
      Stadsbibliotek, utan biblioteket som idé. Jag syftar på alla bibliotek i
      kollektiv singularis. För att över huvud taget förstå varför det finns
      bibliotek, måste man ta hänsyn till de två prinicperna.</p>

      <p>Den första principen är att det är lönsamt för de som läser och
      studerar att dela böcker. Böcker har varit sällsynta, dyrbara och
      platskrävande. Under en stor del av den civiliserade mänsklighetens
      historia har det funnits bibliotek som den boksynte gärna tagit en omväg
      för att kunna besöka. Den andra principen är att man gjort ett undantag
      i upphovsrätten som gör just denna delning möjlig i en
      marknadsekonomi. Författare får en viss ersättning per utlån.</p>

      <p>Förnyarna i biblioteksdebatten ser säkert denna inledning som
      ytterligt konservativ. <em>À la bon heur.</em> Det enda sättet att få en
      träff på i princip enbart mission statements för större Nordamerikanska
      bibliotek är att söka på <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=collect+preserve+organize+provide+access&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N">collect
      preserve organize provide access</a> i Google. Det smyger sig in en del
      arkiv i träffmängden, med det är flest bibliotek.</p>

      <h2>Public service search engines</h2>

      <p>Jag har arbetat med att programmera digitala bibliotek i ungefär 15
      år. Jag startade min första webbserver 1994 och började arbeta
      professionellt med forskning &amp; utveckling på
      digitalabiblioteksområdet mindre än ett år senare. Mitt personliga mål
      har hela tiden varit att <em>inte</em> arbeta med problem vars lösning
      går att köpa, att hela tiden ligga vid någon front. Under nittiotalet
      låg biblioteken faktiskt i framkant i IT-utvecklingen. Vi arbetade med
      att testa var gränserna går. Vårt arbetsområde var information. Böckerna
      var bara en källa. Vid NetLab vid Lunds universitet arbetade vi med att
      bygga sökrobotar och såg det som en naturlig uppgift för oss att
      organisera hela Internet enligt public service-principen. När vi började
      arbetet kunde sökmaskinen Lycos, som hade monopol just då, inte indexera
      dokument med europeiska tecken.</p>

      <p>Ödet ville att vi skulle släppa Nordiskt Webbindex månaden efter Alta
      Vista släppte sin sökmaskin. De kunde, precis som vi, faktiskt söka på
      <em>ål and öl</em>, och att <a href="http://www7.scu.edu.au/1900/com1900.htm">vi skulle presentera
      oss</a> vid the <a href="http://www7.scu.edu.au/">Seventh International
      Worldwide Web Conference 1998</a>, samma konferens där två unga
      studenter från Kalifornien, <a href="http://www7.scu.edu.au/1921/com1921.htm">Lawrence Page och Sergey
      Brin</a>, presenterade en ny sökmaskin som de kallade Google.</p>

      <p>Jag ägnade mig åt att sälja insamling, bevarande, organisering och
      tillgängliggörande av Internet ytterligare något år, sedan fick andra ta
      över. Det finns ingen som vill finansiera organisering av informationen
      på Internet enligt public service-modellen. Jag programmerar fortfarande
      digitala bibliotek, men det är en annan historia.</p>

      <h2>Biblioteket i Chris Anderson's värld</h2>

      <p>Som biblioteksperson tillhör jag den minoritet som <em>aldrig</em>
      arbetat med annat än digital library R&amp;D. Som sådan kan jag inte
      förstå varför inte Chris Andersons böcker <em>The Long Tail</em> och
      <em>Free</em> inte nämnts en enda gång i Sydsvenskan. Åtminstone inte i
      de artiklar som jag har läst.</p>

      <p>Det traditionella biblioteket är inklämt mellan Akademibokhandeln, å
      ena sidan, och Amazoogle å den andra. Google har som uttalat mål att
      organisera <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-magazine/archive/2009/08/features/the-unstoppable-google.aspx">all  information
      i världen</a>.</p>

      <p>Boklådorna säljer hitlistornas material, och Amazoogle distribuerar
      resten.</p>

      <p>Information väger ingenting längre, den är inte dyr och tar inte så
      mycket plats. Inte ens fysiska böcker är dyrbara att lagra om man har
      ett magasin långt ute in the middle of nowhere. Med rätt logistik
      fungerar det ändå.  25% av Amazon's försäljning är titlar som ligger
      utanför deras 100,000 toppsäljare. De har ett helt nätverk av
      antikvariat bakom sig för att kunna tillfredsställa de mest esoteriska
      önskemål. Vad Malmö Stadsbibliotek betraktar som hyllvärmare är big
      business för Amazoogle.</p>

      <p>I massdigitaliseringens årtionde är de utgallrade böckerna
      hårdvaluta.</p>

      <h2>En demokratisk kulturnations minne</h2>

      <p>Skall vi ha hus med böcker? Det inte är uppenbart att vi behöver
      sådana hus. Problemet är likartat som när René Descartes betvivlade sin
      egen existens. Det gäller att hitta en punkt där vi kan nysta upp 
      den härva av argument vi sett för Biblioteket. Det finns
      faktiskt en sak som bara bibliotek gör, och det är att bevara
      kulturnationens minne. OK, Malmö Stadsbibliotek slänger en del. Men tro
      mig, de skulle inte slänga sista examplaret av en titel, om den råkade
      finnas i samlingarna där.</p>

      <p>Små som stora bibliotek samlar och bevarar. Det finns lokalsamlingar
      ute vid folkbiblioteken. De stora nationalbiblioteken gör sådant som att
      bevara Worldwide Web. Det görs vid Kungl. Biblioteket i Humlegården och
      vi gör det vid Det Konglige Bibliotek i København.</p>

      <p>Allt detta samlande utgör den demokratiska kulturnationens minne. Vi
      kan inte överlåta denna uppgift till någon annan. Vare sig till
      Akademibokhandeln eller Amazoogle. Inte ens till <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. Om vi börjar vid
      denna punkt kan vi förstå att vi faktiskt inte skulle klara oss utan
      biblioteken.</p>

      <p>Varje kommun, region och nation måste samla, bevara, organisera och
      tillgängliggöra. Den som inte gör det kommer att förlora en viktig del
      av sig själv. Minnet. Vi måste tillhandahålla unikt material via webben
      i våra digitala bibliotek, vi måste ha en rent fysisk infrastruktur i
      form av läsesalar där studenter tentamensläser och raggar. Varje
      målgrupp måste ha sina faciliteter.</p>

      <p>Ja, och så kan vi bygga vidare. Och då har vi snart mentalt byggt ett
      hus med böcker, och dessutom insett att vi behöver det. Även om somliga
      köper sina Stieg Larsson och Camilla Läckberg på ICA, och sin De
      Consolatione Philosophie via amazon.com.</p>

      <p>Problemet är närmast när vi inom biblioteksväsendet börjar skämmas
      för att vi faktiskt tjänar den demokratiska kulturnationens
      minne.</p>

  <title>Add footnotes to my pages -- a prototype text annotation
  interface</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/footnotes/"/>
  <summary>I've had a javascript based forum with thread for each entry. That
  seemed boring to me. Why should users be restricted to commenting entire
  articles. Why not letting them add footnotes to arbitrary positions in a
  text. In this entry I experiment with this feature.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>In order to understand what's going on here, you have have to <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/footnotes/">visit the
      resource</a>. There is a some scripting going on which cannot be
      syndicated. If you're reading this, you are on the wrong
      page. Sorry.</p>

      <h2>What you can do here</h2>

      <p>There is a link at the top of this page (if you're reading the HTML
      version <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/footnotes/">directly from my
      site</a>, that is). It says "Show anchors". It's not a very user
      friendly description of what it does, but I cannot figure out a better
      term right now. If you click on it, there will appear a link after most
      words in the text. These are the annotation anchors of this text.</p>

      <p>When visible, the anchors appears as a clickable asterisk '*', and a
      click on one of them activates the usual <a href="disqus.com">disqus.com
      forum</a>. This is by some client side DOM programming.</p>

      <p>Submitting a footnote works, but the script never get the
      acknowledgement from the disqus.com server. I don't know why, but it
      seems that the form doesn't like to live in an iframe.</p>

      <p id="anchor55576b680.592539918884886">My server retrieves the
      annotations from the disqus.com web services and print a list of notes
      at the end of the page. This is done server side, shuch that the
      discussions within the footnotes will be visible by search engines. The
      place of the annotation is marked as a note with a link to the
      notes. You may read the annotation when your mouse is over the link.</p>

      <p>Is this a good idea? Do you like it? Should all my pages have user
      supplied foot notes?</p>
      
      <h2>How is it done</h2>

      <p id="anchor55018b510.584488500647474">In order to add footnotes to a
      text, we need to be able to address individual positions in it. These
      positions are what I'd like to call annotation anchors. I've already
      briefly discussed the problem on how to create identifiers (see a <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/quotations/">A
      quotation is much more than an extract</a>). For this entry I've
      extended the xslt script such that it can <a href="http://exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/">tokenize</a> html text
      embedded in atom entry documents. It can also add anchors (id
      attributes) on each individual word (produced by the tokenize function)
      in the whole text. We also implement a javascript which expose these
      anchors to users, and allow them to comment more or less arbitrary point
      in the text.</p>

      <p id="anchor55402b10.359095368701543">There is a <strong>big</strong>
      drawback in this procedure; once you have processed your text and the
      anchors are there, then you <strong>must not</strong> change them. Each
      word has become a resource on the internet. Please view the source of
      this document, before you use the stylesheet <kbd><a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/footnotes/atom_anchor_id.xsl">atom_anchor_id.xsl</a></kbd>.</p>

      <pre>
	&lt;span id="anchor54764"&gt;Would&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54766"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54768"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54770"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54772"&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54774"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span id="anchor54778"&gt;text?&lt;/span&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>See what I mean? I cannot author prose like that in my XML
      editor. You wouldn't suffer as much using WYSIWYG tools, but on the hand
      it would presumably destroy the ID-strings.</p>

      <p>When preparing this text, I felt that I had to prepare some
      annotations of my own, and in order to do that I compiled the text,
      published it, made my annotation and then pasted the ID back into the
      source XML in order to be able to continue writing. Formbased proof
      reading of an existing digital text wouldn't be any problem, though.</p>

      <h2>Javascript &amp; DOM scripting</h2>

      <p>You can find the possible anchors by clicking on the link
      <strong>Show anchors</strong>, and hide them again by clicking on
      <strong>Hide anchors</strong> at the same place (there is a
      toggle). There are two javascript functions handling the toggling. The
      possibly most interesting, but also, the most vulnerable, feature is the
      generation of javascript from rss for handling the readable
      notes.</p>

      <pre>
      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	    var usedAnchorIds = new Array();
	    var noteTexts     = new Array();
	    
	    usedAnchorIds[0]="anchor55402b10.359095368701543";

	    noteTexts[0]='I had problems obtaining unique id strings from the'
	    +'generate-id() function in XSLT. (siggelundberg, Fri, 18 Sep 2009'
	    +'17:46:27 -0000)';

	    usedAnchorIds[1]="anchor55018b510.584488500647474";

	    noteTexts[1]='This is an arbitrary point in my text. I find this'
	    +'really suitable for adding a footnote. (siggelundberg, Fri, 18 Sep
	    +'2009 03:27:16 -0000)';

	    printNotes(usedAnchorIds,noteTexts);

    &lt;/script&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The rest of the features are readily visible on this page. You have
      to reaload the page to see the new footnote -- if I implement this I'll
      will refresh those asynchronously.</p>

  <title>Twelve weeks</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/09/twelveweeks/"/>
  <summary>It is twelve weeks since i refurbished and redecorated this
  site. It is time for an evaluation...</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">


      <p>It is about twelve weeks since i refurbished and redecorated this
      site. It is time for an evaluation. I do ask myself more or less daily
      if I can continue to say that this is worthwhile? My answer has been yes
      so far. I also ask myself if I do a good enough job, and to that my
      answer has been: Yes, I believe that some of my entries are good
      enough.</p>


      <div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">

	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/09/twelveweeks/usage.pdf">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/09/twelveweeks/usage.png" alt="About 12 weeks usage statistics for my site." width="100%" border="0"/>
	</a>

	<p>
	  <small>Figure 1. Average number of visits per week for my site
	  sigfrid-lundberg.se (in blue) and the average time (in seconds)
	  people stay there (in red). Week 1 in the graph is the starting June
	  14, 2009. The last week is August 23 to 29.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>The number of visitors has been growing steadily from only a few
      individual visitors per week, to about two dozen. But on the other hand
      the time spend reading have declined dramatically (Figure 1). I do have
      a handful of visitors staying for a couple of minutes reading my weekly
      entry. This is easy to tell from the google statistics. I have no graphs
      on this, but distribution of time spent per visit is bimodal. A majority
      stays less than ten seconds, very few stay for a minute but a larger
      minority stay for three to five minutes, perhaps reading one entry and
      skimming another.</p>

      <p>My most successful entry is <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/">On Divorce and
      Unemployment Benefit Societies</a>. I do think it deserves it, but the
      key to its success is that I wrote a comment on Google Research Blog, <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/posted-by-hal-varian-chief-economist.html">the
      place</a> that inspired me to write in the first place. Just yesterday I
      got 26 visitors through that blog entry.</p>

      <p>That entry was also the one that took most time to write, followed by
      my text <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/">On being an
      international commuter</a> where the actual wordsmithing took an awful
      amount of time. Two people has told me that they thought it was funny.</p>

      <h2>Subject matters</h2>

      <p>I've mentioned earlier that I started all this by adding categories
      to all material that existed here before (mind you, this site is fifteen
      years old). I've hardly used any of them. Why should I. I'd rather not
      wright anything about harvesting or Z39.50. (I've done both the last
      three years, but these topics doesn't interest me anymore.)</p>

      <p>I suppose I should figure out a new system to categorize my material,
      but then why should I?</p>

      <h2>It does take time</h2>

      <p>All this writing takes time, and energy. I feel that I have to
      publish something every week. I mostly use the time I spend on train
      between Lund and Copenhagen, but I also use several hours on evenings
      and weekends on this. You cannot start a project which is time consuming
      without side effects. I read less novels and literature just for the fun
      of it. I've hardly touched my flute and <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/Degeberga_duo.shtml" title="me       and my son Erik cooking porridge while playing a polska">recorders</a>
      during this period.</p>

      <p>I've read somewhere that it takes about half a year to establish a
      blog, and I suppose that's about it. I won't write about web statistics
      until then.</p>

  <title>The predigital library</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/diglib/"/>
  <summary>What is the strategic goal for a library web site? Could it be to
  put the library on the web, or is it basically to the library's resources
  visible to users anywhere on the globe?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p><q cite="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED6-12.html">The
      digital revolution is over</q> wrote <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED6-12.html">Nicholas
      Negroponte already 1998</a>. According to <a href="http://escherman.wordpress.com/2008/03/12/the-digital-revolution-is-over-nicholas-negroponte-in-1998/">one
      source</a>, whose credibility I have not evaluated, Douglas Adams once
      described Nicholas Negroponte as someone who <q cite="http://escherman.wordpress.com/2008/03/12/the-digital-revolution-is-over-nicholas-negroponte-in-1998/">writes
      about the future with the authority of someone who has spent a great
      deal of time there.</q> The declaration of victory for the digital
      appeared in Negroponte's last regular column in the Wired Magazine. He
      might've thougth: <em>We've won, and now is time for giving one lap top
      to every child on the globe.</em> That would indeed consolidate the
      victory.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;">
	<br/>*
      </p>

      <p>After the digital revolution, it was natural for the library
      community to create a vision of moving <em>The Library</em> onto the
      Internet. The libraries were rising new buildings all over the globe
      called digital libraries. One particularly good one is <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a>. CDL was
      founded 1997, i.e., the year before the digital revolution ended. The
      CDL web site is very typical in many ways. In particular its home
      page. It starts with a corporate site, and on it there is a list of
      services <q>powered by CDL</q>. For example:
      <a href="http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/">Calisphere</a>,

      <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/escholarship/">eScholarship
      Editions</a>,

      <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/">eScholarship
      Repository</a>,

      <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/homepage.html">Mark Twain Project
      Online</a> 

      and 

      <a href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/">Online Archive of California
      (OAC)</a>.
      </p>

      <p>There is much more available. I just took those from the top
      page. Most of these services are brilliant, they about the best you can
      find from any library on the globe.</p>

      <p>We see here the main method of moving the library to the Internet:
      The creation of repositories. Just as we have structured the library
      into collections, the major ones may have seperate reading rooms, the
      digital library is split into seperate services. The information
      resources from California Digital Library are spread over many,
      different domains. I'm not critizing my colleagues over there. Rather
      I'm just stating a fact that more or less all digital libraries -- even
      the best ones -- are suffering from the same problems, of which the most
      important one is that <strong>all of us are building a new repository
      whenever we start a new project</strong>.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;">
	<br/>*
      </p>

      <p>We see now a shift from the repository is the gravitational center
      for the digital library towards the resources themselves. There should
      be no need to go to the digital library, its content should be on the
      Web. There is no need to move the library to Facebook to be where the
      users are. It is sufficient to have the library resources on the Web --
      which isn't the same as having the library there.</p>

      <p>Carl Lagoze et al. uses this shift as a justification for proposing
      the new standard OAI-ORE. When discussing the differences between the
      old OAI-PMH and the new OAI-ORE, they formulate the trend in a very
      clear way:</p>

      <blockquote style="margin-left:+5%;font-style:italic;" cite="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2273v1">

	<p>It <span style="font-style:normal;">[OAI-ORE]</span> also reflects
	a recognition of the position of digital libraries vis-à-vis the Web
	that sometimes seem to co-exist in a curiously parallel conceptual and
	architectural space.</p>

	<p>We exist in a world where information is synonymous not with
	<q>library</q> but with the Web and the applications that are rooted
	in it. In this world, the Web Architecture is the lingua franca for
	information interoperability, and applications such as most digital
	libraries must exist within the capabilities and constraints of that
	Web Architecture. Because of the virtual hegemony of Web browsers as
	an information access tool and Google as a discovery tool, failure to
	heed to Web Architecture principles, and therefore requiring somewhat
	special treatment by these <q>monopoly applications</q> (which is
	rarely if ever granted), effectively means falling into an information
	black hole.</p>

      <p>Lorcan Dempsey of OCLC research, is involved in among lots of things,
      statistical analyses of media use. In that work he and his colleagues
      are forced to make som operational definitions of the 'book'. Definitions
      that inspired Lorcan to make some <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/002000.html">interesting
      reflections on books</a>.</p>

      <p>I once had a chat with a book historian. Her view is was that a book
      is defined by its binding. The binding is the most important part of a
      book. Without it, it's just a pile of paper.</p>

      <p>My answer was as follows: Assume that an author is writing a
      book. While working on it there is a mansuscript -- which is a computer
      file. After a year or so, the book is completed and is accepted for
      publication.</p>

      <p>In my view it is now a book. After all <em>the book has been accepted
      for publication</em>. When you send it to the printers workshop, then I
      suppose it is manuscript. On the other hand, when you download the thing
      from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a> to your kindle,
      then it's a book.</p>

  <title>Five years that formed the digital library as we know it:

  <summary>It appeared to me that many the standards and technologies
  underpinning the digital library as we know it were formed during five years
  around the turn of the century.</summary>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I sat there looking up references for a text. Then I realized that
      there were these five years, 1997-2001. They were decisive for the
      coming nine to ten years digital library development. For the fun of I
      looked up some events that occured during these five years</p>

  <title>A quotation is much more than an extract</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/quotations/"/>
  <summary>In my last entry, on cool URIs, I discussed the identification of
  documents. The conclusion from that is that people in the library world are
  obsessed by being able to find documents. I take that more serious than most
  other library folk. I'd say that it is our mission to help our patrons find
  a single word in a text, a rectangle in an image and so forth. The time is
  gone when we could tell users: The answer to your question might be in any
  of the books on that shelf.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p><em>'We quote,'</em> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=duUQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;ci=164%2C315%2C723%2C168&amp;source=bookclip">writes Isaac
      D'Israeli</a>, <em>'to save proving what has been demonstrated, referring
      to where the proofs may be found.'</em> How much wisdom isn't embedded
      in this single line! If we did not quote, then we had to explore or
      invent everything anew ourselves. We do need methods of referring our
      readers to the source. Worldwide web provides eminent facilities for
      this, such as the hypertext link.</p>

      <p>With a quote we can make our lives as writers more comfortable. We
      can, as D'Israeli continues, <em>'screen ourselves from the odium of
      doubtful opinions, which the world would not willingly accept from
      ourselves'</em>. How wonderful! I can thus market ideas that noone would
      find credible when coming from me, or refer to ones that I would not
      myself dare to publicize. The actual stylistic use of referencing belong
      to the art of writing, which is distinct from the art of hypertext.</p>

      <p>Google books provide writers with exellent facilities for hypertext
      linking. For instance, you can cut a piece of text and put into your own
      page. Like this:</p>

      <a title="Quotation like much better things has its abuses One may quote till one compiles." href="http://books.google.com/books?id=duUQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;ci=150%2C1240%2C753%2C64&amp;source=bookclip" style="margin-left:10%;text-align:center;">
      <img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=duUQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U18wMKXLnxI-TBSM7IJ4VUTCz8bhQ&amp;ci=150%2C1240%2C753%2C64&amp;edge=0" border="0" alt="Quotation, like much better things, has its abuses. One may quote till one compiles."/>
      </a>

      <p>There are dangers of quoting, as D'Israeli makes clear. When you you
      cut and paste too much, you're no longer authoring. You're
      compiling.</p>

      <h2>The annotation anchor</h2>

      <p>If you've followed my links above you've seen how one can link to a
      page in a text, how we can highlight an area in an image and also quote
      by cutting a snippet out of an image. The single points, areas or ranges
      in an object which can be used for referencing is in my world called
      <a href="http://scholar.google.se/scholar?q=%22annotation+anchor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=S%C3%B6k">annotation anchor</a>s.</p>

      <p>In text we anchor a reference by using a unique sequence of tokens.
      In this particular text, <em>unique sequence of tokens</em> could have
      served the purpose, if I hadn't it repeated here. The position of a
      footnote could have been persistently anchored just by that sequence. In
      hypertext, we typically use mark-up for the purpose. There is a drawback
      in that, a user can only anchor his or her reference in the predefined
      positions. However, if the text is completely tokenized each single word
      is available for the purpose (see <a href="#ps">below</a>). </p>

      <h2>Persistence</h2>

      <p>Any user interface for searching and navigating parts of an object
      requires new thinking when it comes to persistence policies.  The
      libraries' HTTP hostile resolution procedures fails utterly. There is
      also much less research in the area <a href="http://scholar.google.se/scholar?q=%22annotation+anchor%22+persistence&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Sök">persistence
      and annotation anchors</a>.</p>

      <p>Very competent search and navigation systems, such as the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/projects/xtf/">eXtensible Text
      Framework</a> (XTF) from California Digital Library, allow users to
      search, navigate and link to arbitrary parts of a document. XTF is used
      to deliver the following document: <a href="http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8r29p2ss">http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8r29p2ss</a>.</p>

      <p>Now, here we have <em>extremely good</em> facilities for navigation
      and search, facilities that goes far beyond what can be delivered by
      Google. But, alas, the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/">ark based</a> persistent
      identification layer isn't used for those facilities, and any linking or
      quotations or references pointing into the document might die
      with this particular implementation.</p>

      <p>The PI people lives with ideal of delivering documents, in the same
      way as they were delivered at the lending counter 25 years ago.</p>

      <h2>Linked data</h2>

      <p>I don't think anyone involved in current web development has escaped
      the linked data bandwagon. Linked data and the semantic web is believed
      by many to become the core of Web 3.0. Tim Berners-Lee <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">lists four
      characteristics</a> of the web of data.</p>

      <em>
	<ol>
	  <li>Use URIs as names for things</li> 
	  <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
	  <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the
	  standards (RDF, SPARQL)</li>
	  <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more
	  things.</li>
	</ol>
      </em>

      <p>Anyone who wants to jump the bandwagon by means anything else on than
      than good old cool URIs does so at his or her own risk, and I
      won't. For, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=duUQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;ci=137%2C351%2C711%2C137&amp;source=bookclip">as
      D'Israeli puts it,</a> <em>'the art of quotation requires more delicacy
      in the practice than those conceive, who can see nothing more in a
      quotation than an extract.'</em></p>

      <h2 id="ps">PS</h2>

      <p>If you're interested in experimenting with mark-up based anchors,
      I'll give you a <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/quotations/add-id.xsl">XSLT-script</a>
      which basically copies a XML document but while doing so it adds an id
      attribute to every element in your document. I find this extremely
      useful. You can extend it to <a href="http://exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/">tokenize text</a> and
      add anchors on individual words.</p>

      <p>I use such a script when creating search and navigation systems
      involving XML text. Beware though that a document type may use the
      generic xml:id attribute. Also, a DTD or schema may have another name
      for id attribute and also it may not be permissible on all elements.</p>

  <title>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned... I have moved a
  document</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/cooluris/"/>
  <summary>The initiatives behind the persistent linking is trying to change
  the status of old documents. From 404 to 200. We've had some success with
  books and journals using ISBN and ISSN numbers. Why not try to copy this to
  the web? But, alas!, library people have in general too little understanding
  of the Worldwide Web. In particular those who advocate persistent
  identifiers.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>This comes to you as an afterthought. I killed other peoples' links
      when <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/features/">I
      last week moved a document</a>. I've felt guilt for this for a week
      now.</p>

      <p>Status 404 is a pain in the arse. You've found that link.  Apparently
      it contained some vital information for you. And then it's gone...
      We've all seen this. And since the end of the last century there have
      been people working on it, many of them coming to from the library world
      where I belong as well. The Germans seem to be most ardent. Followed by
      the Finnish and us Swedes.</p>

      <p>I full well understand people who try do something against URI rot.
      Mind you, I've spent six years of my life maintaining harvesting robots.
      However, I've hated URNs intensely since the end of the last century
      when I realized that people who hardly knew anything about HTTP,
      hypertext and markup commissioned technical solutions, such as URNs and
      URN resolvers as futile fixes to human and organizational problems.</p>

      <p>Those who know me also know that I have very strong emotions about
      persistence. These emotions started long before I had read Tim
      Berners-Lee's brilliant paper <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs don't
      change</a>. Tim did get one thing wrong in that paper: <em>URI's never
      ever change, people move (or remove) the documents.</em></p>

      <p>Once you've formulated a URI, it will exist until the end of
      networked information as we know it (or until the end of the world,
      whichever happens first).</p>

      <p>By the end of the nineties, the <a href="http://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/extra/muut/meta/">Nordic Metadata
      Project</a> had commissioned a technical solution where we in the Nordic
      Web index should identify all pages with DCMI metadata and in particular
      those that where using encoding scheme URN for identifier.</p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, I found a couple of thousands such &lt;meta&gt;
      tags searching my databases. The only snag was that they all appeared on
      two sites. <a href="http://www.runeberg.org/">Project Runeberg</a> had a
      very neat collection with digitized books, each with a unique URN
      embedded in the cover page, and then <kbd>isPartOf</kbd> elements for
      each chapter.</p>

      <p><a href="http://aronsson.se/">Lars Aronsson</a>, the main architect
      behind Project Runeberg, had made his homework. However, most of the
      DCMI identifiers with encoding scheme URN were found on the web site of
      the <a href="http://www.kb.se/">Swedish National Library</a>. The only
      snag here was that all of them contained the same value.</p>

      <p>I worked for a couple of weeks with this, but result was useless
      because of the incompetence of the very people who marketed these ideas
      in Sweden. For some years to come, I sat on many meetings listening to
      them talking about the status of URN:NBN in Sweden, and for each time I
      heard about it my anger increased.</p>

      <p>One document colleagues have wanted to discuss with me the last few
      years has the following URI:</p>

      <pre>
	<a href="http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:7-isbn-90-6984-508-3-8">http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:7-isbn-90-6984-508-3-8</a>
      </pre>

      <p>It leads to Hans-Werner Hilse and Jochen Kothe, 2006.
      <em>Implementing Persistent Identifiers</em>, published by <a href="http://www.cerl,org/">Consortium of European Research Libraries,
      London</a> and <a href="http://www.knaw.nl/ecpa">European Commission on
      Preservation and Access</a>.</p>

      <p>Sending a HTTP HEAD request to the URI above yields the following
      response:</p>

      <p>Obviously people in Germany love maintaining resolution
      services. First there is this global one at DNB, Deutsche
      Nationalbibliothek, and then the local one at Göttingen.</p>

      <p>It does not help them very much, though. I've been through <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=link%3Anbn-resolving.de%2Furn%3Anbn%3Ade%3Agbv%3A7-isbn-90-6984-508-3-8&amp;btnG=Search">all
      links pointing to this booklet</a>. Only four out of fifteen points to
      the canonical source. To put this another way: Whenever Gesellschaft für
      wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung moves their documents, three quarter
      of the links pointing to them are gone.</p>

      <p>I have tried for hours to find any document in Google Scholar with a
      reference pointing to the Finnish URN:NBN resolver. If there are any,
      I ensure you that they never appear in papers with any impact.</p>

      <p>The money spent on maintaining the resolvers doesn't help. A complete
      waste of both time and Euros if you ask me. The PI is a dead concept,
      promoted by organizations who fail to learn from experience. It is
      completely incompatible with modern thinking on web technologies, and in
      particular semantic web and annotation and navigation of complex digital
      resources. Sorry, I felt the anger boiling up inside me again.</p>

      <p>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned... I have moved a document.</p>

  <title>Changed URI for my feed, and a forum for discussions</title>

  <summary>Having actively maintained my site for some, I've decided make a
  few changes...</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Dear Reader!</p>

      <p>I've got <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SigfridLundbergsStuff?format=xml">a
      new URI</a> for my ATOM feed. I appologize for the inconvenience. This
      entry will be the only one available at the original one. Feed burner
      provides so many advantages that I cannot ignore them. Just click on the
      link above and subscribe, and you'll get my scribbles as usual. However,
      I've got another new feature as well.</p>

      <p>The really substantial responses I've got on this site I got from my
      <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/jacob.shtml">colleague
      Jacob</a> and <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/Gertrud_berger.shtml">my wife
      Gertrud</a></p>

      <p>Both agree that my note on <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/">commuting
      is brilliant</a>. I'm grateful for that, but as far I can tell from the
      download stats, they are the only ones who like it. Then Jacob told me I
      ought to have a forum for discussions in relation to my scribbles. Well,
      then... I've added one of those nifty javascript based ones, <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus.com</a>. Then Gertrud said: You'll
      never find the time to moderate that. We'll see.</p>

      <p>I guess it's more likely that it will be yet another of those
      pathetic empty discussion things on the net.</p>

  <title>On Divorce and Unemployment Benefit Societies</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/"/>
  <summary>Here I analyse of some data retrieved from Google Insight
  Search. This little study is inspired by the study performed by Hyunyoung
  Choi &amp; Hal Varian, Google Research, were they were able to show that it
  is possible to make short-term forcasts of economic behavours using search
  statistics.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Hyunyoung Choi &amp; Hal Varian, Google Research, have claimed that
      it is possible to make <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/posted-by-hal-varian-chief-economist.html">short
      term economic forcasts</a> using analysis of search terms entered into
      the Google search engine. In particular, they have shown that there is a
      positive correlation between the search interest for terms related to
      the filing for unemployment benefits and the number of people who
      actually file for unemployment benefits. This number has previously been
      shown to be a very good predictor of a future increase in
      unemployment.</p>

      <p>The search interest for terms in the <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#cat=706&amp;geo=US&amp;cmpt=q">Welfare
      &amp; Unemployment category</a> appear to be a predictor of the number
      of people filing for benefits. I read these papers &amp; blog entries
      with great interest. The search data are easily accessible. You retrieve
      them through a search form, and you can get them in CSV, so they can be
      loaded into your favorite statistics program via excel or any
      work-alike.</p>

	</p>
      </div>

      <p>Having read Choi &amp; Varian's brilliant <a href="http://reseabrch.google.com/archive/papers/initialclaimsUS.pdf">little
      paper</a> (well, I'm neither economist nor statistician, but I think
      it's good), I just had to test this data source myself.</p>

      <p>My idea was to track down effects of the recession on everyday life
      and changes in peoples views of things. It is indeed easy to find such
      correlations. <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=john%20maynard%20keynes&amp;cmpt=q">John
      Maynard Keynes</a> has experienced a formidable revival during the last
      six months or so. I had expected to see some shift in interest, where
      Karl Marx should gain Adam Smith would loose. <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=Adam%20Smith%2CKarl%20Marx&amp;cmpt=q">I
      think that there is such a trend as well.</a>.</p>

      <h2>Cross country correlation</h2>

      <p>In Denmark and Sweden we have to become members in a unemployment
      benefit society, i.e., we have to pay for an insurance policy against
      unemployment in order to get a sizeable unemployment allowance. There is
      a governmental dole as well, but that one is really so diminutive that
      it will hardly keep you from the street. Hence, we hardly get any
      benefit or allowance as some kind of charity from the other tax
      payers. You have to pay in advance through your membership in an
      <strong>a kass<em>a</em></strong> in Sweden or an <strong>a
      kass<em>e</em></strong> in Denmark.</p>

      <div style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/kassa.png">

The search interest for the Danish search term 'a    kasse' (y axis) plotted against the corresponding Swedish 'a kassa'    the same week. The green line represent the least square fit.

	<p>
	  <small>Fig. 2. The search interest for the Danish search term 'a
	  kasse' (y axis) plotted against the corresponding Swedish 'a kassa'
	  the same week. The green line represent the least square fit. There
	  is quite some scatter but the positive correlation is highly
	  significant (n=177, t=4.252 and P<sup>***</sup>&lt;0.00004,
	  two-tailed).</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>Now, these two words does not appear in any other language, and I can
      safely look up the <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=a%20%20kassa%2Ca%20kasse&amp;cmpt=q">search
      interest</a> in Google Insight for Search and be fairly sure that these
      terms are not used elsewhere. The result is depicted in Fig. 1. Note
      that for a better part of 2004 one or both columns were zero. I've
      regarded those as missing values and removed them. The same was true for
      a few datapoints representing the future. I have plotted the data as
      delivered, and it seems to me that Google applies some kind smoothing
      such as a spline function. Their graphs are much smoother than mine.</p>

      <p>It seemed to me that major peaks appeared at the same time in both
      countries. To test this I made a linear regression and correlation
      analysis. The correlation is indeed highly significant, which would
      indicate that Swedes and Danes start looking for an unemployment benefit
      society during the same periods in time. Makes sense to me. The two
      countries' economies are tightly coupled and both depend on the same
      global market.</p>

      <div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/divorce-da-series.png">
	  <img src="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/divorce-da-series.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 3. Search interest for the terms 'a kasse' and    'skilsmisse', i.e., unemployment benefit society' and 'divorce',    respectively in Danish."/>

	  <small>Fig. 3. Search interest for the terms 'a kasse' and
	  'skilsmisse', i.e., unemployment benefit society' and 'divorce',
	  respectively in Danish.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>From what I can see, this correlation is OK theoretically. For all
      practical purposes we can regard the Swedish and Danish as taken from
      distinct populations, the only factor they have in common is time, and
      information in media about the international economic development (which
      off course include the development in the neighboring countries).</p>

      <h2>Until death do us part</h2>

      <p>The day after I had convinced myself that the Danes and Swedes
      recognize the risk for being made redundant at the same time, I read in
      a Danish news paper that the rise in unemployment was leading to an
      increase in divorce rate in Denmark. Most people can end their life
      without help of Internet.</p>

      <p>Ending a marriage is a bit more difficult. To divorce you must get in
      contact with a lawyer and applicable authorities. You need to fill in
      and sign a lot of forms. All this is something that require information,
      which users expect to find on the Internet.</p>

      <table border="0" width="40%" style="border:none;float:left;margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">

	<caption style="border:none;background:white;border-bottom:solid  thin;">Table 1. Top ten divorce related searches in Google,

	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>Table 1 shows Google's top ten list for divorce oriented search
      terms. Jon and Kate are obviously a reality TV series in the US, so this
      one reflects a voracious appetite for gossip rather than a need for
      information.</p>

      <p>Then there is a group of users who are interested in statistics, such
      as divorce rate. This won't help you to get a divorce and is purely
      factual. The same true for divorce law, but here we reach the border
      line between pure fact and pure HOWTO. It is good to know the law if you
      need a divorce, isn't it?</p>

      <p>All in all, I'd say that more than half of
      these terms are searches aiming at divorce HOWTO documents. The same is
      true for Scandinavian search terms.</p>

      <div style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">

	  <small>Fig. 4. Correlation analysis between search interest for

	  r=0.162793, n=194, t=2.28622, P<sup>*</sup>&lt;0.05 (two-tailed test).</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>These considerations make it interesting enough to attempt the method
      I used for correlation above, but now for "divorce" and "unemployment
      benefit society" within each of the two countries. The Danish statistics
      is in Fig. 3-4 and the Swedish in Fig. 5-6.</p>

      <p>Danish search interest for unemployment benefit societies seemed
      lower than in Sweden (Fig. 1). Also, the Danish search interest for
      divorce "skilsmisse" is higher than for unemployment benefit societies
      "a kasse" (Fig. 3), whereas in Sweden the reverse is true. We Swedes are
      search less for "skilsmässa" than we do for "a kassa" (Fig. 4).</p>

      <p>These correlations, if real, have not, for me at least, any obvious
      interpretation. A few <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/factoid">factoids</a> as a
      background. I list them without references -- this is not a scientific
      report, but a blog entry. They my recollections from radio news and the
      daily newspapers:</p>

      <div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/trends/divorce-sv-series.png">

	  'skilsmisse', i.e., unemployment benefit society' and 'divorce',
	  respectively in Swedish.</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p><strong>i.</strong> Denmark had a lower unemployment before the
      current recession than had Sweden. This is still true. We have
      good reasons to look for a good unemployment benefit society.</p>

      <p><strong>ii.</strong> In Sweden the unemployment is biased such as it
      affects larger degree affects males than females. This is due to the
      crisis within the automobile industries we imported from the other side
      of the Atlantic.</p>

      <p><strong>iii.</strong> The Danish divorce rate 2.92 per 1000
      inhabitants) is higher than the one in Sweden (2.24). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography">Both figures from
      2004</a>.</p>

      <p>It could be possible to understand the different correlations in Figs
      4 and 6 in the light of these three factoids. It would help if there is
      an asymmetry between males and females, such that the latter are a bit
      more mercyful towards their unhappy unemployed spouses than are the
      former. I.e., if Swedish women think somewhat like: <em>Well, I want to
      leave the bastard, but I don't have to do it this week when he's so
      miserable. I'll search for "skilsmässa" in Google later on.</em></p>

      <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

      <p>First and formost I wish to point out that the analyses in this blog
      entry are made by someone who has forgotten most, if not all, the theory
      behind statistical inference. I've not performed any serious statistical
      analysis for more than fifteen years. In addition the fact that my
      knowledge about statistical inference has decayed to below a statistics
      101 level, I've never worked with proper time series analysis. I fear that
      not any of my tests here would hold a critical analysis by a
      professional. To make sense, the divorce analysis require some kind of
      time lag. You don't become member of an unemployment benefit society the
      same week your spouse get fed up with you because of your bad
      unemployment temper. The latter comes later.</p>

      <p>Anyway, the purpose of this note wasn't to make a really serious
      analysis <em>per se</em>, but to explore Google's claims that one could
      use search data for serious work. I think they are right. These data are
      available for free; you can test an idea in a few days and then decide
      what more experimental &amp; survey kind of data you'll need to make a
      test your hypotheses.</p>

      <h2>PS</h2>

      <p>There are more to say about this.</p>

      <p>Unemployment is no fun. The fact that unemployment can break marriges
      doesn't worry me too much. However, some people <a href="http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/2009071635221/academia-and-research/rise-in-unemployment-linked-to-suicide-rate.html">cannot
      live with unemployment</a>. That is much worse.</p>

      <p>Obviously there are companies out there subscribing to terms related
      to suicide, depression, drug abuse, alcoholism and the like as
      adwords. A superficial look at the ads appearing in relations to such
      searches doesn't convince me that people who search for help this way
      necessarily get the best professional help available.</p>

      <p>There is a lot to do in this area. There are a many of governmental
      and charitable organizations that do great work. Serious mental problems
      should not be treated by quacks, and the subscription to adwords related
      to such terms should, in my view, not be available to just anyone. I'm
      not even sure that I think it is a good idea that pharmaceutical
      industries should sell their drugs this way.</p>

  <title>What does Free mean for The Library</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/blogging/"/>
  <summary>Blogging is out, and the new trend is to tweet in
  Twitters. Syndication is out as well, since Google steals your content and
  you cannot make money on journalism. How can we survive when all media are
  free?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Chris Anderson's book has finally appeared. The new one,
      <em>Free</em>, much discussed already before it was printed, and, off
      course, much hyped in the <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired
      magazine</a>. I've just ordered it from Amazon, but I've been walking
      around thinking about Internet business models, open access and the
      like. I've also <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2004/biblioteket/">written at length
      about this</a> (in Swedish, I'm afraid).</p>

      <p>How is <em>Free</em> related to the situation for <em>The
      Library</em>?  Well...  I'd say: in just about any way you may
      imagine. However, let me start at an entirely different angle. Blog and
      Wiki software were at the time the first easy ways to really take
      advantage of the new medium based on hypertext, a simple protocol and a
      global network.  Through additions such as syndication and pings
      (notifications that new content have appeared) and automatic
      cross-linking (based on pings) to enable discussions across blogs, it
      goes beyond hypertext.</p>

      <h2>Built for interaction and transactions</h2>

      <p>This gave us basically a new medium built for transaction and human
      interaction.</p>

      <p>When a blog really takes off, the traffic generated is enough for
      letting the ads pay your rent and buy milk for your kids. Obviously some
      quality is required or it won't take off in the first place. (Quality
      which is in the eye of the beholder). Content which is hard to get
      elsewhere. That is what gives the attention needed for the transactions
      to take place.</p>

      <p>Blogging is cheap. You write about what's around you that you
      know. You benefit from from the transaction and attention economy which
      feeds the Internet. Syndication, aggregation and harvesting will move
      you're content around, and you'll mostly benefit from it.</p>

      <h2>Syndication, harvesting and leeches</h2>

      <p>On the other hand, much of the user's navigation will take place
      elsewhere, and many user's will not be exposed to your ads but Google's.
      This lead to Jakob Nielsen's out-cry where he labelled them as <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search_engines.html">leeches</a>
      already a few years ago.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/authors/71">Michael Massing</a>
      discusses this and other issues in a <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22960">recent article</a> in The
      New York Review of Books. He quotes David Simon's statement in a
      testimony in front of the US Senate:</p>
      
      <blockquote>[Internet] <em>leeches... reporting from mainstream news
      publications, whereupon aggregating web-sites and bloggers contribute
      little more than repetition, commentary and froth. Meanwhile, readers
      acquire news from the aggregators and abandon its point of origin—namely
      the newspapers themselves. In short, the parasite is slowly killing the
      host.</em></blockquote>

      <p>There is a problem deep in this statement. It assumes that there
      would be no news without the traditional media. Since the traditional
      media are on the decline, We can be almost certain that this is not the
      case. Massing continues:</p>

      <blockquote>... <em>such statements seem as outdated as they are
      defensive. Over the past few months alone, a remarkable amount of
      original, exciting, and creative (if also chaotic and maddening)
      material has appeared on the Internet. The practice of journalism, far
      from being leeched by the Web, is being reinvented there, with a variety
      of fascinating experiments in the gathering, presentation, and delivery
      of news. And unless the editors and executives at our top papers begin
      to take note, they will hasten their own demise.</em></blockquote>

      <p>Do we really need these big media institutions? What use do we have
      for Reuters, CNN, AFP etc. They are good to have, but I'd say we could
      do without them. For example, the notion that we cannot get proper
      information from distant places without having expensive foreign
      correspondents travelling there seems extremely arrogant to me, on the
      verge of being racist.</p>

      <h2>Adaption and struggle for existence</h2>

      <p>This is not to say that we don't need journalism. Indeed we do. But
      as Massing states, it is currently reinventing itself on the Internet. A
      new one which has adapted itself to the medium. One which is part of the
      transaction &amp; interaction based technology and economy.</p>

      <p>Now, let us return to <em>The Library</em>.</p>

      <p>The business model <em>The Library</em> is based upon is the idea
      that it will save money to share media. It started with scholars sharing
      papyrus scrolls two thousand years ago. Continued with libraries within
      monastic societies during the middle age, where books were extremely
      valuable assets. Then, today, we're licensing electronic material which
      is meant to save money as an alternative to pay per view.</p>

      <p>Those who invented <em>The Library</em> had clearly in mind
      collections of stuff that were not <em>Free</em>. Stuff that are scarce
      and only legal to copy for fair use. Produced by organizations that
      think that Google is stealing their content.</p>

      <p>In Chris Anderson's world, and in Google's, the value of information
      is declining. Material which is <em>Free</em> or open access have the
      price corresponding to a zero marginal cost of producing one additional
      copy.</p>

      <p>Who will fund each University library's fumbling and overlapping
      attempts to collect, preserve, organize and provide access to virtually
      the same digital resources through very similar integrated library
      systems? And do these resources belong at <em>The Library</em> at all if
      they are <em>Free</em>?</p>

      <p>I leave these questions as an exercise to the reader (hint: think
      about the economics of blogging). And end this by quoting Google CEO <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-magazine/archive/2009/08/features/the-unstoppable-google.aspx">Eric Schmidt</a></p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>“We don’t have a big picture. We don’t have a five-year plan, we
	don’t have a two-year plan, we don’t have a one-year plan. We have a
	mission and a strategy, and the mission is… you know, [to organise]
	all the world’s information. And the strategy is to do it through
	innovation. It doesn’t bother us if something doesn’t work. Because we
	understand that something else will work.”</em>
      </blockquote>

  <title>Wagging the long tail</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/indexing_philosophy/"/>
  <summary>The problem with providing an OK Amazoogle experience is that we
  might fail in providing advanced services to patrons that have special
  needs.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>By and large we in the library world have, finally, accepted the
      reality. We do no longer regard the online catalogue's poor usability as
      an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy">information
      literacy problem</a>. As such, there was a remedy: User education. The
      roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. The path towards
      mastering the online catalogue is like a very long session in the
      gym. You feel better the day after tomorrow.</p>

      <p>After (rougly) 2003, there was a general acceptance that the our
      patrons deserved an easier to use interface, and the concept of the
      integrated library system was born. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_next-generation_catalogs">new
      kind of system</a> should be so easy to use that new generations used to
      <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000562.html">Amazoogle and
      Googlezon</a> should not be frustrated by the complications of the
      typical scanlists generated by the library opac upon the entering of a
      long and complicated query in <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Command_Language">CCL</a>.</p>

      <p>The user preferences have been known for a long time. For instance,
      all users of the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/17/SearchUsers">Open
      Text search engine</a> used the simple form, except those that
      didn't. They used the advanced one, and they amounted to about 0.5% of
      the grand total. Such users belong to the tip of some <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">long tail</a>, and they do know what
      they want to know, but knowing that might not help if we cannot
      deliver.</p>

      <p>I heard a story from a librarian at The Royal Library. A student
      appeared at the information desk at one of our reading rooms requesting
      a list of contemporary Japanese literature translated into Danish for
      some paper in translation studies. Our nice ILS <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview">Primo</a>
      provides an OK Amazoogle experience. But, well... An user hostile
      boolean fielded search in the rusty old OPAC did the job.</p>

      <p>The good news is that the advanced search form is much cheaper to
      build than simple one. That one is still the real challange. Even for
      Google.</p>

  <title>Why I love XSLT extension functions</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/xslt_extensions/"/>
  <summary>xslt extensions allow you to define xpath functions and extension
  elements. That makes it easy for you to perform tasks within xslt that are
  just only theoretically possible to do.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I started learning XSLT eight years ago. At the time, it was a fresh
      technology, and there was also intense discussions on the extensibility
      of the language. Since then xslt 1.1 has disappeared down the drains,
      xpath 2.0 &amp; xquery 1.0 appeared on the market. The former of these
      has had a slow start. The latter, however, has gained acceptance,
      however a bit reluctant.</p>

      <p>The stuff I want to discuss here is the writing of extension
      functions. This is regarded as an evil habit in some parts of the XML
      processing communities, but it is supported by most implementations. It
      is not to be recommended if you're producing a stand-alone application,
      but in many cases you're xslt code is an integrated part of an
      application. Most of my code is of this kind; in particular I'm writing
      xslt for xalan running in a JAVA environment. Now, why should I refrain
      from using regex, just because xalan does not support this package? I
      cannot see why. And nobody would ask me to write ANSI SQL in spite of
      the fact that we use Oracle.</p>

      <p>Now, it has been proven mathematically that xslt is a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-xalanextensions.html">Turing
      complete</a> programming language. That means that it is possible to
      program <strong>anything</strong> which is possible to program with such
      a language. I.e., you have theoretically the same possibilities as in
      JAVA and C++. That doesn't mean that it is practical do do so. It is, in
      my view, much easier to traverse a XML tree in XSLT than in (say) JAVA,
      whereas it is much easier to connect to a database or implement a XSLT
      processor using a conventional programming language.</p>

      <p>It is here the XSLT extension functions become really useful. You can
      pass data from XSLT to your own functions written in your favourite
      programming lanuguage. I use this for tasks like indexing XML
      documents. When traversing a document, you select text and pass it to
      you're function which pass it to your indexing API. One big advantage is
      that the same software can index heterogenous collections of XML
      documents just by using different XSLT scripts. They are easy to write
      and you can a new document type without recompilation of you're indexing
      software.</p>

      <p>This ability of a fullblown functional programming language (mind
      you, its Turing complete) to interface both with a host program and from
      scripts inside it call other functions in other languages is
      powerful. This, in combination that it is really good for what it is
      designed for has made it an object for extreme affection from
      me. Besides I'll return to examples of using XSLT for indexing complex
      XML objects.</p>

  <title>The description and encoding of structure</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/structure/"/>
  <summary>Much metadata is fairly stright forward. A book does have a title
  and an author. That's usually no big deal. We've been able to handle that
  for centuries. A digital book has chapters, and everything you might want to
  know may be in chapter two on page seventyfive. Or someone may tell you the
  solution to your problems after a quarter of an hour in some video on
  YouTube. Now, how do we cope with this?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>Many things in life can best be represented as trees. Indeed, life
      itself is a tree of various life forms. We have the animal and plant
      kingdoms, and these main categories are further sub-divided into phylae,
      classes, genera. The animal kingdom is divided into invertebrates and
      vertebrates. The latter include amphibians, reptiles, birds and
      mammals. Human knowledge is also depicted as a tree.</p>

      <p>A lot of other things are trees. Hence, philosophers, mathematicins
      and computer scientists have put quite an effort into the modelling
      stuff as trees. Within library &amp; information science we have used
      the term classification systems for centuries, I suppose, and more
      recently we have started to talk about ontologies and knowledge
      organization. There are a lot of theory and a plethora of standards in
      this area. Systems like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_Maps">topic maps</a> (see also
      <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/">topicmaps.org</a>) and more recently
      Simple Knowledge Organization System <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>) are available for those
      who need a standard for knowledge organization.</p>

      <p>On a very down to earth level, I tend to think of controlled
      vocabularies as filters and navigators. The latter are trees and may
      contain many terms arranged into a tree of arbitrary depth. The filters
      are lists of controlled terms, which may be whereabout in the tree we
      are. Think of Yahoo Directory. You can browse into <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Italy/Regions/Tuscany/">Tuscany</a>
      and get a very long list of resources. Then there is a menu at the top
      where you can choose between "Business and Shopping", "Entertainment and
      Arts", "Recreation and Sports", "Travel and Transportation" and so
      forth. These are broader categorizations that apply to Firenze as well
      as Siena or New York city or any place you may want to visit. We in the
      Web business call them <em>filters</em> or <em>facets</em>.</p>

      <h2>Recognizing and recalling</h2>

      <p>From a user perspective, you have to take into account that there are
      two cognitive processes involved when using services which like Yahoo
      Directory employ navigators and filters. The first process is more
      fundamental, and is by nurture and possibly nature a part of the human
      mind: This is to say: Ah Tuscany, that is a part of Italy, isn't
      it. It's like distinguishing between a wasp and a bumble bee. On an
      evolutionary time-scale we've benefitted from being able to say, this is
      edible this is not, or this one has a sting and is likely to use
      it. This is to recognize something when you see it.</p>

      <p>The opposite is a much more difficult cognitive process: I want to
      know something about Tuscany: Ok, I then start by clicking on Italy. You
      have to connect Italy with Tuscany, not only recognize the word Tuscany
      when you see it. This makes it more difficult to find Tuscany given
      Italy than Italy given Tuscany (in Yahoo it's in the bread crumb
      path). Remembering might not be trivial. To know in advance things like
      "frogs are amphibians" and that "diabetes is an endocrinological
      disorder". On the other hand, to perform successful searching in Google
      is even more demanding, in spite of google suggest and spell checking
      tools that have improved the search comfort for many users.</p>

      <h2>Ordered Hierarchies of Content Objects</h2>

      <p>There are structures that are inside a resource, and that require
      navigation as well. As a first approximation we can assume that all
      digital resources, such as electronic books, are trees as well. In the
      theory of text this model is called OHCO (ordered hierarchy of content
      objects). That view has been questioned, and it is for instance claimed
      that any ordinary text consists of many, <a href="http://www.stg.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html">overlapping
      hierarchies</a>. I just love overlapping hierarchies. They are great
      fun.</p>

      <p>Anyway, if you search the scientific literature on the theory of
      text, you'll find everything you want to know about post-structuralistic
      deconstruction of the OHCO model. Theoretically, I can understand the
      problems. But for me they are purely academical.</p>

      <p>If you instead search Google books for some real content, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?spell=1&amp;q=nightingale+lark+balcony&amp;as_brr=1">nightingale
      lark balcony</a> you'll find Romeo &amp; Juliet in her bed room. Scene V
      in Act III of Romeo and Juliet, on page <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=09qTVKsjwSwC&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=nightingale%20lark%20balcony&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA189">189</a>,

      <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H_EjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=nightingale%20lark%20balcony&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA160">160</a>
      and a lot of other page numbers, dependent on which edition. In the
      world according to me, you may have a lot of hierarchies and they may
      overlap, and OHCO may be false. But if you want to be able to address
      content in a more clever way than the one chosen by Google books, then
      you cannot do without a content model that looks like, well, very much
      like a tree.</p>

  <title>Will the research libraries play a role in e-science</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/escience/"/>
  <summary>I was asked to participate in an e-science pilot project.  The work
  in the project has been food for thought for me. Will libraries be a part of
  a future eScience infrastructure?</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      
      <p>I was asked to participate in an e-science pilot project. The pilot
      is directed towards social science, and its main goal is to find out
      what we could do in the area. Should libraries play a role in a future
      eScience infrastructure? If yes, what could we do for our patrons in
      this area?</p>

      <p>That the answer should be yes to the first question is obvious for
      anyone responsible for the strategic development of any research library
      around the globe, but the second question is clearly more difficult to
      answer.</p>

      <p>Libraries have, traditionally, been occupied with four activities:
      They collect, preserve, organize and provide access to
      information. Indeed a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=collect+preserve+organize+%22provide+access%22&amp;btnG=Search">search</a>
      for these four terms in Google seem to yield a search very focussed on
      mission statements for Northern American research libraries. <em>It
      isn't farfetched to conclude that we could extend this role to include
      research data in digital form</em></p>

      <h2>A happy hypertextual symbiosis</h2>

      <p>In my vision, our role may not end here. The task should involve an
      infrastructure permitting the our existing information (published in the
      form of books, journals and whatever) live in a happy hypertextual
      symbiosis with the research data it is based on.</p>

      <p>In this ecosystem of data and models scientists should be able to
      combine old stuff in new ways just and continue building the human
      knowledge by submitting new data. Every piece of data need to be
      possible to address, for the purpose of annotation as well as for
      retrieval. Every piece of data, any point in a diagram need an
      identifier. And it has to be a URI.</p>

      <p>No single organization will be able to afford to build the
      infrastructure needed by any research community. The good news is that
      no single organization need to build it. The web of data, which has to
      be the eScience infrastructure, will almost certainly be the Worldwide
      web. Nothing less, nothing more.</p>

      <p>This is the vision of <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">linked data</a>
      and the semantic web, rephrased in the context of scientific
      information.</p>

      <p>By tradition libraries are aimed for some local community. In
      particular, the are funded by some local authority for that
      purpose. Hence they build collections suitable for that community.
      This local focus is a problem when everything else is Worldwide.</p>


      <p>The idea of the web of data as a foundation for an eScience is a good
      idea, and most likely the only one that will work. Indeed it is so
      obvious ones that any actor within the business of scientific
      information are about to adopt it; publishers, learned societies and
      libraries alike. However there are others that are interested. Google
      eScience doesn't sound too exotic to me.</p>

      <p>Google eScience is not a threat, per se. The web of data need data
      feeds. We can provide that. The problem is our local scope, and in
      particular the focus on a local community. But that boils down to the
      local funding.</p>

  <title>The predator rests on its prey</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/victory/"/>
  <summary>I've seen this image before. An excavator has demolished a
  building, and has then proudly been parked on top of the remnants.</summary>

      <p>Is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug">Smaug</a>
      resting on a pile of gold? Or a predator resting after a victorius
      battle with a powerful prey?</p>

      <p>Obviously neither. But I've seen this image before. An excavator has
      demolished a building, and has then proudly been parked on top of the
      remnants. The building was a petrol station from the sixties. I'll not
      miss it; it was an ugly building. The shop inside it was
      poor. That's not the point.</p>

      <p> The point is just <strong>why this gesture of aggression</strong>?
      Why is the excavator always parked on top of the remnants? Is it a
      gesture of triumph? Has the present once again earned a victory over the
      past?  It is the choice of parking place which is the question.</p>

      service</a>, what is the client? Obviously the web client, the
      browser. But why are the search engines lagging behind?  Browsers are
      capable of AJAX and advanced XML processing, but the search engines are
      still basically just removing tags and presenting raw text extracts.</p>

      <p>I have quite a few documents on this site that are written in raw
      XML, such as the <a href="/2008/dighum/digital_humanities.xml">Digital
      Humanities Infrastructures</a> position paper from last year. Since it
      is about digital humanities and text encoding, I wrote it in <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI</a> XML. The paper is presented using
      client side XSLT. Just view source on that note, and you'll see my
      markup. The document is a blatant show-off; it is written in nerdcore
      vanity. At the top you'll see</p>

      <pre>
	&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
	&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="render.xsl" type="text/xsl" ?&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The <kbd>xml-stylesheet</kbd> processing instruction is read by your
      browsser, which then retrieves the stylesheet <a href="/2008/dighum/render.xsl">render.xsl</a>. Without any further ado
      it is then transformed into html, rendered using the CSS indicated by my
      XSLT script for you to read. You can even inspect the resulting html
      using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a>, if you've got a
      modern installation.</p>

      <h2>What does Google do when indexing XML?</h2>

      <p>There is almost certainly a range of XML formats that is actually
      interpreted by Google. Which formats, well we don't know but in practice
      can hardly expect anything more exotic than common syndication formats
      (such as RSS and ATOM ), <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=99170">microformats
      and RDFa</a>. I have noticed that Google has been doing OAI harvesting
      for many years, most likely for the benefit of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Scholar</a>.</p>

      <p>One could envisage a number of viable indexing strategies for a
      general search engine for a document like my Digital Infrastructure
      Nerdcore Vanity paper. One would be to execute a global regex search and
      replace "&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;" with "" (which basically means: remove
      anything between angle brackets, or remove all tags).</p>

      <p>This would yield a "detagged incipit", which in this case is "Digital
      Humanities Infrastructures 2008-06-12 Digital Humanities Infrastructures
      Sigfrid Lundberg"</p> 

      <p>Another strategy would be to use the style sheet provided by the nerd
      publishing this paper. That would yield the "transformed incipit", which
      for this document is (using the HTML body only) "Digital Humanities
      Infrastructures Sigfrid Lundberg". In using the transform, Google would
      then be able to use its usual HTML indexing techniques. For instance it
      would understand the title, and be able parse all hypertext links.</p>

      <p>I made the search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=digital+humanities+infrastructure+%2Blundberg&amp;btnG=Search">digital
      humanities infrastructure +lundberg</a> and the results looks like
      "<strong>Digital Humanities Infrastructures 2008-06-12 Digital
      Humanities ...</strong> - Jun 5 ... Digital Humanities Infrastructures
      Sigfrid Lundberg slu@kb.dk Digital .... Also McCarty's humanities
      computing research infrastructure (or rather ..."</p>

      <p>The machine is actually using a detagged incipit as the title, which
      is what I think it uses for PDF. This is very far from the ideas in
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/">Gleaning Resource Descriptions
      from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL)</a> where providers of documents
      actually provide XSLT for the benefit of robots that could use that to
      extract descriptions in RDF.</p>

  <title>OpenSearch, RSS and OPML as XML Webservices for information
  retrieval</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/opml/"/>
  <summary>At the Royal Library we have been working with the building of an
  infrastructure for publishing of digitized material. It is collections of
  digital images, usually with very little textual content to go with it. It
  is quite a challenge to build workflows satisfying the needs of technical
  staff running the scanners, the librararian and editorial staff doing the
  cataloging and the needs for crosswalking metadata from the OPAC and at the
  same time be able to syndicate the material in other services adhering to
  different standards.</summary>

      <p>At the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/">Royal Library</a> we have been
      working with the building of an infrastructure for publishing of
      digitized material. It is collections of digital images, usually with
      very little textual content to go with it.</p>

      <p>The cataloging of the images has been made by library staff using the
      image database system Cumulus from <a href="http://www.canto.com/">Canto</a>.  Cumulus is designed as digital
      asset management system for people within graphical industry. Canto is
      producing an advanced Web user interface, but it is rather poor as
      regards dissemination of the collections on the web. For example, images
      published that way never ever appear in Google Images. Syndication of
      our content has not been possible, since the system have been lacking
      any concept of standardized metadata, which is essential for all
      collaboration between institutions in the library communities.</p>

    
      <div style="float: left;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;">
	<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
	  <a href="http://static.grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=s&amp;file=http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8">
	    <img alt="Grazr" src="http://static.grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" style="border:none"/>
	  </a>
	  <script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://static.grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=s&amp;file=http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8">
	  </script>
	</div>
      </div>

      <p>To take advantage of the relative ease of use for the people handling
      the images, but still be able to provide access to our collections on
      the Internet we have an entirely new web interface. For performace
      reasons, we decided that it should <em>not</em> access the cumulus
      database directly, but a mirror in our Oracle DB. Furthermore we wanted
      a REST XML web service layer.</p>

      <p>The latter goal was achieved by using two syndication services, built
      on top of Oracle. The two services were written as JAVA servlets, and
      supported Outline Processor Markup Language (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071019150004/http://opml.org/">OPML</a>) and <a href="http://www.opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a>, together with RSS. The
      rationale for the latter choice of standard was that we wanted
      mainstream Internet Standards rather than typical library standards such
      as <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/">SRU</a>. OpenSearch is
      promoted by <a href="http://a9.com">A9</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and there are at least pledges
      of support from other big players such as Google and Yahoo.</p>

      <p>OPML was not an as obvious choice. However, OpenSearch is basically a
      Syndication protocol and as such OPML is a candidate since its most
      common usage is to provide subject structured access to feeds. An early
      version of the system is available on our web site, the first version
      was released for about a year ago. Our technology choices makes it
      stright forward to syndicate the content. The gadget on this page is an
      example of this. It is a gadget showing the OPML and RSS from the first
      collection of images released in this way, <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a>,
      a collection of historical images from a few Danish cities. The widget
      itself is "The Original Feed Widget" a nifty thing coming from <a href="http://grazr.com">grazr.com</a>. You can make one of your own by
      filling in the URI <a href="http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8">http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8</a>
      in the form on grazr.com.</p>

      <p>The use of truly simple de facto Internet standards is one
      advantage. But we needed a way to build traditional web contents on top
      of our two web services. Sites as <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a>
      mentioned above, and its "cousins" <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/kistebilleder/">Kistebilleder</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/daellsvarehus/">Daells
      varehus</a> and <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/partiprogrammer/">Partiprogrammer</a>. All
      these are actually delivered by one single servlet, which is most
      appropriately described as a mashup-engine.</p>

      <p>The engine is written in-house, and supports multiple skins (as seen
      in the examples above -- <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a> differs from <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/kistebilleder/">Kistebilleder</a>).</p>

      <p>In this application a skin is a XML document, which consists of the
      lay-out for the html page (it is little more than the HTML). Appart from
      html tags it also contain &lt;kb:include/&gt; tags identified by they id
      attribute. Each kb:include tag corresponds to a REST XML web service and
      is connected to a XSLT script via configuration file. The mashup engine
      reads the skin at initialization, and upon a request it retrieves the
      required OPML or RSS, transforms the content, pastes these fragments
      into the skin DOM tree and finally delivers the content to the
      client.</p>

      <p>The mashup engine is not very well written. I can do better. Also the
      current set of services requires an Oracle schema per collection
      disseminated which is wasteful. We've haven't got the time yet to fix
      the first problem, but the second problem is about to be solved since we
      have a second generation of web services in the pipe-line for release
      real soon. In this application we've just one single Oracle database for
      all editions served. I will give you a report on that one when it is
      online.</p>

  <title>About this site</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/colophon/"/>
  <summary>I'm a terrible nerd. To use software like content management
  systems or blog software is unthinkable for me. There are many ways to build
  a site like this. I have chosen one that maximizes the use of angle
  brackets.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>I'm a terrible nerd. To use software like content management systems
      or blog software for building my web site is unthinkable for me.</p>

      <p>I have a substantial collection of old stuff written for various
      purposes in very different formats; it is a must to be able to integrate
      that material into the site. Some of this material are hard-core XML
      documents in text encoding initiative or docbook XML. There are also
      documents in legacy formats, such as RTF and (GNU) troff. I'm still
      using troff for production of new texts, usually via transform from XML
      using XSLT. The more recent XML documents are using client side XSLT for
      viewing.</p>

      <p>This material is growing. I see it as an extension of my CV, but some
      of it could be interesting for users since it is general documentation
      for how to solve certain kinds of problems. I also wanted to seemlessly
      integrate other, more lightweight, material. Like this article</p>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>

      <p>As I mentioned <a href="/entries/2009/06/why/">the other day</a>, I
      wanted a new navigation system. There are two requirements on that: (i)
      it should be easy to follow for users and (ii) the pages in it should be
      good landing pages for search engines. I felt that there was a need for
      more text that would generate hits in search engines without out being
      irrelevant for users and misrepresent the content. Finally I wanted the
      site to be somewhat like a blog. In spite of the improved look and feel
      I also wanted that all the material already published on the site should
      retain the current URIs.</p>

      <p>The old site was just plain files, I did no scripting whatsoever on
      that site. I couldn't, however, possibly manage a navigation system a
      manually, so some scripting had to be involved in generating the
      site.</p>

      <h3>Metadata and XML processing</h3>

      <p>To generate the navigation system, I have catalog all existing
      'static' material. In particular I had to index manually using keywords
      or "tags". I decided what material to include and wrote manually a
      single monolithic metadata file in XML using using <a href="/entries/2009/06/atom/">the atom syndication format</a>.</p>

      <p>Having this file it was easy to write a xslt tranform that generated
      the browse by year and subject menues appearing in the left column on
      most pages (that took 61 lines). Then there is another xslt transform
      aggregating the title, summary and link data into menus, such as the one
      in <a href="/subjects/xmlprocessing/">XML processing</a>. This took
      about 200 lines of xslt.</p>

      <p>Now, these two xslt scripts take into account only the older kind of
      static material. I also wanted a new kind of bloggish 'dynamic'
      material. I needed to integrate the two kinds of material in a single
      structure. Just as I wrote the metadata for the older set of material in
      Atom feed document, I write the bloggish kind of stuff in Atom entry
      documents. They live in a file system <kbd>/entries</kbd> under the
      document root.</p>

      <p>To integrate the two I have a nifty little perl script that does two
      things. It reads the Atom feed for the and parses it into a Document
      Object Model (DOM) object. Then it traverses the <kbd>/entries</kbd>
      file system, parses each entry. First it drops a transform into html of
      each entry. The entry itself is entered into the global DOM, which is
      finally printed into a complete Atom feed. This took 65 lines of perl
      and 84 lines of xslt.</p>

      <p>To get a blog style home page I had to sort the entire set inversely
      in temporal order, print the most recent entry on the home page and
      finally print a few pointers to more recent entries. These tasks took
      another 250 lines of xslt. In addition I have a utility which generates
      the <kbd>/entries</kbd> directories and prints a skeleton entry, which
      generates another 100 lines of perl which generates the skeleton using
      XML DOM.</p>

      <p>It takes less than a second to rebuild the entire site. Before the
      refurbishment, I used to copy all files to my server. In order to
      implement incremental update, I've created a CVS repository on my
      server. Now I check in everything using CVS after building and testing,
      and then I publish my stuff by checking out in the servers document
      root. This will scale up to a some thousand blog entries. Then I'll
      ingest my entries in Oracle Berkeley DB XML and replace most xslt with
      XML Query.</p>

      <p>Or I'll do that anyway, for the fun of it.</p>

  <title>Min mor</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/06/mor/"/>
  <summary>Min mor var 43 år gammal när hon födde mig 1956. Alltså föddes hon
  själv 1913, året innan första världskriget bröt ut. Nu är hon 96, och lever,
  som hon säger, på lånad tid. Tid, det är något som hon tar på största
  allvar. Vi talas vid per telefon varje dag. Hon ringer 20.10, nästan

      <p>Min mor var 43 år gammal när hon födde mig 1956. Alltså föddes hon
      själv 1913, året innan första världskriget bröt ut. Nu är hon 96, och
      lever, som hon säger, på lånad tid. Tid, det är något som hon tar på
      största allvar. Vi talas vid per telefon varje dag. Hon ringer 20.10,
      nästan exakt. Det blir alltid ett trevligt samtal.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-left:0.5em;float:left;">
	<img src="http://www.sigfrid-lundberg.se/galleri/200902-200904/smaller/cimg1150.jpg" alt="Mor i dörrent"/>
      </p>

      <p>När det är dags att säga godnatt, återkomer hon ständigt till att man
      måste vara tacksam för varje dag som gått, och att "i morgon är det en
      ny dag". Visst har Mor rätt! Det är faktiskt inte är självklart att man
      får leva hela nästa dag. Har man hunnit med ett långt liv, så är man
      mer medveten om den saken än vad vi, yngre människor, är.</p>

      <p>Jag tänker på det ibland, att hon har varit med om en stor del av
      1900-talet, och hur hon kan tala om arbetslösheten på 30-talet, om
      Krügerkraschen 1931. Då var hon en fager ung kvinna 18 år gammal. Mor
      har varit folkpensionär under i princip hela mitt yrkesverksamma liv,
      hon föddes innan ryska revolutionen och lever faktiskt fortfarande.  Hon
      arbetar fortfarande i trädgården. "Ni behöver inte vara rädda, jag kan
      inte trilla när jag sitter på marken," berättade hon nyligen.</p>

      <p>I mars i år fick hon höra på radion om SEBs nyemission nu i mars
      månad tog hon rollatorn ner till Handelsbanken. Som folkpensionär tjänar
      hon 7000 kronor i månaden, så för att köpa de femhundra hennes innehav
      berättigade henne till, fick hon höja sin checkkontokredit. Vi fick 200
      aktier var, jag och min bror. Det var för sina barns skull hon köpte
      aktierna på lånade pengar.</p>

      <h2>En ny påminnelse om vår dödlighet</h2>

      <p>I dag när vi talades vid berättade hon om gravstenen. Min far dog i
      september i fjol 93 år och tre månader gammal, men det är först nu som
      vi fått gravstenen på plats, och Mor är lycklig för det. Den är i lite
      mer äldre stil, hög och smal, inte så där bred och låg som många
      gravstenar är numera. Jag har inte sett den själv ännu, men mor säger
      att den är vacker. Huggen i grå granit från Östra Göinge, i trakten
      kring Glimåkra, där Far växte upp. Texten är i Garamond, stilen som Far
      tyckte bäst om, jämte Berling Antikva. Far var boktryckare och vi har
      nog åtskilliga hundra kilo Berling Antikva i källaren efter honom.</p>

      <p>Mor ser illa. Hon har både grå starr och gula fläcken och kan inte
      läsa inte tidningen längre. Men lyssnar hon på radio det gör hon. Jag
      tror att hon sitter där i köket och lyssnar mest hela dagen. Inte missar
      hon en nyhetssänding om hon kan undvika det. Ekot och i synnerhet
      ekonomiekot är viktigt. Radioföljetongen och radioteatern är hennes enda
      intag av skönlitteratur nuförtiden.</p>

      <p>Mor började skolan 1920. Det var inte så ovanligt på den tiden att
      flickornas utbildning försummades på bekostnad av gossarnas. För hennes
      del blev det aldrig mer än sexårig folkskola. Istället läste hon in
      nästan stora delar av en gymnasiekompetens på KOMvux mot slutet av
      60-talet och början av 70-talet. Det blev dock inte moderna språk eller
      matematik, för det var hennes förkunskaper för klena.</p>

      <p>Dagligen diskuterar vi utvecklingen i världen, och hon berättar annat
      som hon har hört på radion. Mor har stor tillit till att Barack Obama
      och hoppas på fred i mellersta östern. Nu senast har hon talat en del om
      PO Enquists som går som radioföljetong just nu, med författaren själv
      som uppläsare.</p>

      <h2>En kopp kaffe</h2>

      <p>Vi åker hem till mor var eller varannan helg, jag och min bror. Vi
      byts om för att hon skall få besök oftare.</p>

      <p>När jag är hos henne äter vi lunch tillsammans. Sedan lyssnar vi på
      lunchekot medan vi tar en kopp kaffe på maten. Sedan stänger vi av
      radion och går igenom posten, mest fönsterkuvert. Nästan varje gång ber
      hon mig att läsa jag högt ur tidningen. Börsnoteringarna för hennes
      aktier och dödsannonserna måste jag läsa varje gång vi träffas.</p>

      <p>Så är det i livet. När man är ung funderar man kanske inte så mycket
      över det, men det är ju så att man umgås väldigt mycket med människor
      som är som man själv är. Unga umgås med unga, småbarnsfamiljer med
      varandra och de diskuterar barn. När man kommer upp i medelåldern
      diskuterar man barn, barnbarn och sjuka föräldrar. När blir gammal
      gammal läser man dödsannonserna. När man är så gammal som Mor är det
      få kvar av hennes vänner att läsa om där.</p>

      <p>Efter kaffet språkar om allt möjligt. Ofta går vi en promenad, men
      oftast tycker hon bättre att gå uppför än nerför. Rollatorn rullar för
      fort och det är lätt att hon inte hinner med den i nerförsbacke.</p>

      <p>Mor tycker om poesi. Hon kan en hel massa dikter och psalmverser
      utantill som hon gärnar citerar när det passar. Hon har tränat yoga
      sedan hon fyllde 60, och hon tränar varje dag. Jag tror också att hon
      dagligen läser alla de dikter och psalmer hon kan utantill, och i
      synnerhet JO Wallins:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Ack, när så mycket skönt i varje åder<br/>
	av skapelsen och livet sig förråder,<br/>
	hur skön då måste själva källan vara,<br/>
	den evigt klara</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Fast hon kan minst fem verser till.</p>

  <title>My first serious experience with ATOM</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/06/atom/"/>
  <summary>You don't really understand a document format until you've manually
  encoded some documents, and written the software to parse and use it for
  something useful. This somewhat refurbished version of my web site is to a
  large extent built upon the ATOM syndication format, and here I discuss my
  experience.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">ATOM syndication
      format</a> has been around for almost five years. In comparison with the
      diverse fauna kept in the menagerie abbreviated to the three character
      acronym RSS, ATOM is a well kept standard and much more useful as
      well.</p>

      <p>Now, I've used ATOM before refurbishing my personal web site, but I
      haven't used <em>seriously</em>. That is, I haven't manually encoded a
      sizeable amount of text in it, validated the result, and then written
      software using the data. ATOM is the fundament for this site, since the
      data used for generating the navigation system is encoded that way. I
      may return to that later on.</p>

      <h2>Designed for success</h2>

      <p>Tim Bray lists and provide a thorough discussion of a number of
      characteristics shared by successful mark-up languages (see his article
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070126140434/www.idealliance.org/proceedings/xml05/ship/175/xml2005.HTML">On
      Language Creation</a>). The list of success critera includes items such
      as extensibility, clever but not too extensive use of XML name spaces,
      the posibility of implementing the language using many, widely different,
      datamodels. From Bray's perspective, ATOM seems designed for success. I
      don't know the statistics concerning syndication format popularity, but
      if ATOM isn't yet the leader, it will become sooner or later. Possibly
      in RDF disguise.</p>

      <p>From a modelling point of view there is a few, annoying
      inconsistencies. Let us, for example, compare the <kbd>&lt;author&gt;</kbd>
      element with the <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd> element. A resource may have an
      author, then the author may have a number of properties, such as a name,
      an email address and a home page. The <kbd>author</kbd> for this note is
      encoded as:</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;author&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Sigfrid Lundberg&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;uri&gt;http://www.sigfrid-lundberg.se/&lt;/uri&gt;
  &lt;/author&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>This is, in my view, a sign of good content modelling when it comes
      to metadata. A resource may have a title. A title may have different
      components, for example main title and sub-title. The main and sub parts
      are properties of the title, not of the resource. The authors of the
      ATOM spec did not see that way. A feed may have both. This is annoying
      for semantic puristic nerd like me. Entries, however, may not have
      sub-titles at all, which in my view is an inconsistency as well.</p>

      <p>The biggest flaw is the encoding of category data. A resource belongs
      to a category, i.e., this membership is a property of the resource. The
      category may have an identifier and a name, and this name is different
      depending to language. However, ATOM forces me to use the following
      construct</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;category xml:lang="en" label="structuralwebdesign" term="Structural web design" /&gt;
  &lt;category xml:lang="sv" label="structuralwebdesign" term="Structurell webbdesign" /&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>which in my view is less than excellent. I would have preferred
      something like</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;category label="structuralwebdesign"&gt;
    &lt;name xml:lang="en"&gt;Structural web design&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;name xml:lang="sv"&gt;Strukturell webbdesign&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/category&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>These are shortcomings, but I can live with them. But expect changes
      in this area. The semantic web is here already, and with <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> becoming a de facto
      standard on the internet, the syntactic communities will have to come up
      with something more clever for categorization of syndicated web
      resources.</p>

  <title>Why do I keep this site?</title>
  <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/06/why/"/>
  <summary>Having had a web site for about 15 years, I start to wonder why I
  keep it in the first place.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>A week or two ago I registered this site with Google Analytics. My
      Internet supply provider's statics is virtually useless. Then I've spent
      quite some time cutting and pasting the javascript into my olde
      stuff.</p>

      <p>I haven't cared about this site for about four years and as far as I
      can tell now, this place is hit by a one or two people per day, each of
      which stay less than a minute. Why they come I don't know, and Google
      Analytics won't tell me yet.</p>

      <p>Now, I didn't expect anything else. I use the site as a store for old
      documentation, of which just a few things could possibly be valuable for
      students of Internet history. Most likely, though, they hardly even
      deserve a footnote in the posterity.</p>

      <h3>The origins</h3>

      <p>I started this site autumn 1995. The oldest documents still in the
      public collection is from <a href="/1996">1996</a>. Now, started isn't
      really the right word. I never <em>planned</em> to build a web site
      with old documents. Basically, I started a web server on a development
      machine and devoted an area for project documentation and reports. I
      could then drop a piece of text there and send the URI to my colleagues
      or customers. That is how it started.</p>

      <p>This worked well to begin with, but about five years later the
      rudimentary structure per project was lost. I then made a backup copy,
      and created a structure by year, and copied stuff from the old site into
      it. This is the way it is now.</p>

      <p>I started the current site <a href="/2005">2005</a>, when I left Lund
      university for a new job in Copenhagen. I felt that I just couldn't let
      this material just disappear.</p>

      <p>The site contains quite a few archived files. Counting them gives 241
      HTML files, 21 pdf, 84 xml and so forth. Of these I regard 37 as
      publications of some kind, in the sense that there are links to them
      that may be reached from the home page. It is still just a sample, the
      raw collection contains 2452 HTML files.</p>

      <p>I have no idea if I have benefited from the site, or if the material
      has been useful for someone else. For a few years, notably <a href="/2002">2002</a>, <a href="/2003">2003</a> and <a href="/2004">2004</a>, I did have an idea that I should make an active
      effort to maintain a web site. Some of the best texts are from that
      period.</p>

      <h3>Publish or let it perish?</h3>

      <p>I earn my livelihood as a developer for the Worldwide Web. But this
      site is not a part of what I do for my living. So, should I have it
      available here or let it perish?</p>

      <p>I pay my ISP 250 SEK per month for this, which include a Linux shell
      prompt available via secure shell and some storage. The storage side of
      it is no big deal; I have already a number of USB hard disks around. I
      have also <kbd>*.zip</kbd> and <kbd>*.tar.gz</kbd> files as attachment
      on my gmail account, which provides huge storage and good value for
      money in comparison with what I get from my ISP. But then, 250 SEK is no
      big deal either.</p>

      <p>So I'll keep it, for the time being. I don't think my stuff
      contribute very much to the digital refuse spread over the net. I've
      added an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">ATOM syndication
      feed</a> for the garbage I decided to keep, a subject browsing based on
      the ATOM categories. Finally I've added some texts from the last few
      years. These are basically of the same kind as the rest of my
      stuff. Reports and papers written for some specific purpose and
      republished here entirely out of context.</p>

    <summary>This note discusses different initiatives as regards providing
    access to resources and tools aimed at researchers within the
    humanities. Since the general breakthrough of search services like Google,
    annotation and bookmarking services like del.icio.us and the like, the
    attitudes towards the application of computing within the humanities has
    changed. In addition, the concept of e-science has contributed to make
    scholars positive to apply computing to various problems within the
    humanities.  Following a discussion started around year 2000, we propose
    that it is possible to formalize many humanities computing tasks as
    pipelines between XML processing steps.</summary>

    learn about the quality of service?  In this note we do just that. We
    regard the terms entered into the form as manifestation of our patrons
    needs and in order to find out what they need, we have performed a
    preliminary text mining exercise. We hope that this will help us designing
    a new search facility that will better answer the needs of our

    <summary>Biblioteken existerar för att det finns användare som är beredda

    Under vilka förutsättningar är användarna, eller deras valda
    representanter, redo att betala för bibliotekens tjänster? Går det att
    finansiera lokalt bibliotek när biblioteksresurserna finns överallt och
    ingen särskild stans? Vilken kommun eller vilket universitet kan
    finansiera ett bibliotek som bara har en katalog, men inga samlingar? Och
    när allt kommer omkring, vem vill ha samlingar och varför? De är ju dyra

    <summary>Här rapporterar jag en konvergent språklig utveckling mellan
    forskare och internerna på Långholmen. I båda kategorierna används ordet
    "pek" för att beskriva en kommunikation, bland akademiker var det på
    1980-talet slang för "uppsats" och på Långholmen var det en text som
    skickades med linbana längs med fängelsemurarna.</summary>

    <summary>Denna text syftar till att ge en överblick över vissa områden av

    Utöver användningen av XML inom det digitala biblioteksväsendet ges en
    överblick över modernt tänkande när det gäller metadata, hur XML kan
    tänkas påverka hur vi tar del av, och hanterar elektroniska texter både i

    indexed manually by content providers. The indexing information is
    embedded into web pages using meta tags, and the service is built using a
    harvesting robot.  This article documents the functions of the search
    engine Studera.NU, its robot, search software etc. It aims at providing
    necessary background information both for staff involved in system
    management and future developers. A second aim is to give pinpoint areas

    <summary>Arkitekturen för ett nätverk av tjänster för spridning av

    tjänster. Metadataproduktionen följer standarden Dublin Core. De förra
    typerna av tjänster inkorporeras i nätverket genom interoperabilitet på
    sökprotokollsnivå, medan metadata och fulltext från de senare göres
    sökbara genom en WWWrobot.  Kommunikation inom nätverket utnyttjar

    <title>A regional distributed WWW search and indexing service - the DESIRE
    way</title>
    <link href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/1998/www7/"/>
    <summary>In an attempt to implement a regional search engine we have
    created an open, metadata aware system for distributed, collaborative
    WWW-indexing. The system has three main components: a harvester (for
    collecting information), a database (for making the collection
    searchable), and a user interface (for making the information
    available). All components can be distributed across networked computers,
    thus supporting scalability. The system is metadata aware and thus allows
    searches on several fields including title, document author, and
    URL. Nordic Web Index (NWI) is an application using this system to create
    a regional Nordic web-indexing service. NWI is built using five
    collaborating service points within the Nordic countries. The NWI
    databases can be used to build additional services. Services today include
    special metadata databases, multimedia databases, and statistics about the
    Nordic Web.</summary>
