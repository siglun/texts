<h3>Abstract</h3>
</center>

<blockquote><i>
In an attempt to implement a regional search engine 
we have created an open, metadata aware
system for distributed, collaborative WWW-indexing.
The system has three main components:
a <b>harvester</b> (for collecting information),
a <b>database</b> (for making the collection searchable), and
a <b>user interface</b> (for making the information available). All
components can be distributed across networked computers, thus
supporting scalability. The system is metadata aware and thus allows
searches on several fields including title, document author, and URL.

Nordic Web Index (NWI) is an application using this system to create a
regional Nordic web-indexing service. NWI is built using five
collaborating service points within the Nordic countries. 
The NWI databases can be used to build additional services.
Services today include special
metadata databases, multimedia databases, and statistics about the
Nordic Web.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

WWW is not <i>per se</i>, and never was intended for the finding of
information on the vast information morass called the Internet.
<i>Search engines</i> have been developed to that end.  These search
engines are basically databases, that obtain their information through
special-purpose, automated WWW clients (i.e. robots, spiders) that
more or less intelligently and automatically maneuver themselves
through the information by following the hypertext links found in the
WWW documents.  Today, search engines and search services constitute
important components in any digital library.
<p>

Much of the work presented here has been done in the context of DESIRE [<a
href="#ref8">8</a>], an European Union project in the
Telematics Applications programme, Telematics for Research which aims at the following (quote):

<ul>

<li><em> meeting the needs of research users for better means of locating
the information that is relevant to their research endeavor.</em>

<li><em> creating subject-based information gateways (distributed resource
discovery based on rich descriptions and quality-controlled resource
catalogs based on specific subject areas) by providing methods and
tools for the development of quality-controlled information
catalogs.</em>

<li><em> creating an exhaustive automated indexing of existing World Wide
Web information sources in all subject areas by providing methods and
tools for automatic indexing of information in the World-Wide Web.</em>
</ul>

In this paper, the Nordic Web Index will be used as a primary
example to illustrate an open standards, metadata-aware system for distributed, collaborative WWW-indexing.
The Nordic Web Index (NWI) is a joint Nordic project providing a
searchable, distributed database covering all information on the
Nordic web and based on software developed in DESIRE.

<h3>1.1 Aims</h3>

The project aimed at building a system which:

<ul>

<li> is <b>distributed</b> (the growth of Internet will make the
global, centralized search engines unwieldy) 

<li> builds upon <b>collaboration</b> between several different `service
providers'

<li> is independent of commercial interests and based on a
public service philosophy

<li> should correctly handle Nordic characters such as å and ø

<li> builds upon <b>open standards</b> such as Z39.50 [<a
href="#ref18">18</a>] and Dublin Core [<a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>]

<li> makes it possible to accumulate a base of knowledge and
experience in the area, which is independent of commercial interests
(and hence publicly available).

</ul>

<p>

While developing the NWI, we have given interoperability the highest
priority.  The importance of the adherence to open standards and the
free access to methodologies and knowledge on the Internet can not be
exaggerated.  This includes our WWW documents, which are not
restricted to particular brands of WWW client.

<p>

However, interoperability does not end with World Wide Web and
HTTP. For NWI, openness goes further: Information retrieval is made
according to standard protocols, which makes it possible to cross
search NWI with other bibliographic databases, such as library
catalogs, for instance.  In addition, all NWI software is freely
available via the Net.

<p>

NWI's goals can be defined as the creation of a service that is
continuously and automatically is identifying and indexing all
information available on WWW in the Nordic domains.  In order to
achieve this end, the system must have these functions:

<ul>

<li> A harvester (robot) - for collecting information.

<li> A database - for making it searchable using an information
retrieval protocol (Z39.50).

<li> A user interface - for making the information available for the
general public (using a gateway between WWW and Z39.50).

</ul>

<p>

The harvester, which collects the information, starts by retrieving
one page exactly the same way as an ordinary browser does it.  A
database is created by a program which analyzes the retrieved page and
extracting parts to create a record in the database.  All records in
the database are indexed in order to make them searchable.  The user
interface presents each item in the result set with the title of the
resource, a paragraph of text summarizing information form the
resources, and a hypertext link to the original source.

<p>

As of November 1997, there are five NWI servers, one in each of the
five Nordic countries (Table 1). They cover one country each, except
for Denmark which also harvests from Greenland and the Faroe
Islands. The total size of the combined databases is 4 - 5 million
records.

<h2>2. Background</h2>

NWI traces its origin to the project "Nordic WAIS/World Wide Web Project"
(W4) [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, 
<a href="#ref4">4</a>] which was started
1993. The goal of that project was to (quoting):

<UL>
<LI><em>Contribute to the development of gateway services between two of
the popular protocols, WAIS and WWW.</em>

<LI> <em>Contribute to the understanding of the problems involved by
integrating a typical state-of-the-art library system in the World
Wide Web.</em>

<LI><em>Contribute to the solution of the resource discovery problem by
using the WWW hypertext systems as a well organized front end to the
information resources offered by hundreds of WAIS servers, and by
using WAIS to establish a searchable database of the WWW-based
information resources which can otherwise only be located through
extensive browsing.</em>
</UL>

<p>

W4 was followed by other related projects.  Europagate [<a
href="#ref18">5</a>] was one of those.  In Europagate, the
gateway-technology from the W4 project was developed further.  
A gateway can be described as a computer program which is
translating between two communication protocols (the language
computers speak to each other) in much the same way as a human being can
interpret between, say, Swedish and English.
There were also other
developments, for example the Z39.50 protocol [<a href="#ref18">18</a>]
replaced WAIS [<a href="#ref19">19</a>] for networked information
retrieval.

</p>

The task of developing a harvesting component, and the integration of a
database, a user interface and a gateway were made the pilot project
NWI [<a href="#ref6">6</a>].  Through a number of service providers,
one in each of the Nordic countries, the first version of the NWI
system was realized early in 1997.

<p>

That system is currently being developed further in a number of other projects,
the most important ones are part of DESIRE [<a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>] (where NWI
is the prime demonstrator) and NWI-II [<a href="#ref7">7</a>].

<p>

NWI-II aims at improving the existing service through the
adoption of new standards and protocols, such as Dublin Core Metadata
[<a href="#ref20">20</a>] in collaboration with the Nordic Metadata
project [<a href="#ref10">10</a>]), and other technical improvements.

<h3>2.1 Related projects</h3>
 
The general usefulness of search engine technology was for us an
unexpected bonus.  This became especially clear as our experience of
search engine technology deepened.  There now are ongoing projects and
initiatives that are directly benefiting from the experience gained through
the NWI and the technology developed.<p>

NWI technology is used in projects such as the Nordic Metadata project [<a
href="#ref10">10</a>], Kulturarw<sup>3</sup> [<a href="#ref11">11</a>], "All"
Engineering resources on the Internet (EELS) [<a href="#ref14">14</a>]
and the European Schoolnet (EUN) [<a href="#ref15">15</a>].
Other initiatives will draw upon the NWI and related technologies in
the building of more specialized services within widely different
areas.<p>

Two related activities are Harvest and TERENA--TF-CHIC.  
Harvest [<a href="#ref22">22</a>] is one of the early and open projects
trying to define a harvesting architecture for Internet.
In addition, there is an interesting task force within TERENA
(Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association) [<a
href="#ref12">12</a>] -- TF-CHIC (Cooperative Hierarchical Indexing
Coordination) [<a href="#ref13">13</a>] which is working on means of
integration between different systems for harvesting, indexing and
searching on the Internet. NWI, harvest and other projects are
contributing to the TF-CHIC effort.

<h2>3. System architecture</h2>

Distributed data collection implies that a number of servers will each
have the responsibility for one or more <i>regions</i> or
<i>domains</i> in a broad sense.  These areas of responsibility can be
assigned based upon actual network domains, organizations or
geographical domains just as easily as they could be domains of human
knowledge.
<p>
Through the distribution of data collection, as well as the
provisioning of server functions, the network load exerted by a
search engine can be minimized and its availability be maximized.

<p>

An important part of the architecture is an easy way to filter the
sets of URLs to be indexed according to some subject or domain.
Before a random set of URLs is loaded into the scheduler for
processing, they are filtered through an external policy-filter. This
filter, which is localized for each installation, determines what URLs
are to be harvested given the policy adopted by the installation. It
thus defines the region or domain a particular installation will
cover. The current NWI services are basing their policy-filtering on
network domains (i.e., *.se, *.dk, *.fi, ...) but it could be as
complex as giving a list of servers and URLs to be included.

<p>
Policy-filtering uses a two step selection process. First a positive
selection is done, ie selecting all URLs that constitute this region
(for example all servers in the .dk domain, a list of selected servers
or even more specific only certain directories on certain
servers). Secondly this selection is refined by excluding not wanted
URLs (for example cgi-scripts, binary files or a special directory on
one server).

<p>

The overall architecture for NWI is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.
National service points have been established in all participating
countries. Each service point has the responsibility for building
and maintaining a database covering its country. The database is made
available through the Z39.50 protocol [<a href="#ref18">18</a>]
using GILS profile [<a href="#ref25">25</a>].
Z39.50 is an international standard protocol for searching bibliographic networked databases.  

<p>

The basic architecture of NWI (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>)
implies that, e.g. the Danish server collects information physically
located in Denmark and builds a database of that information. In
addition it will be responsible for the Danish user interface and also
a networked Z39.50 interface to NWI servers elsewhere.

NWI is using the Z39.50 based text search engine Zebra Information
Server [<a href="#ref21">21</a>] together with the Europagate [<a
href="#ref5">5</a>] WWW - Z3950 gateway.
However, the service points could use any other system
adhering to standards supported by NWI since most of the components can
easily be replaced. And there are indeed local variations, both as
regards user interface and configuration of the software.
<p>

Z39.50 and the gateway technology developed in Europagate [<a
href="#ref5">5</a>] make possible simultaneous cross searching in several
different databases.

If one site should be inaccessible, then the corresponding database will be
unavailable. However, the remaining of the databases will still be available,
and users could turn to a user interface in a neighboring country.

at least one robot (H) harvesting objects, and maintaining a database
(DB) and a server providing a WWW-based user interface.

<h3>3.1 Internal structure</h3>

Each local NWI service is a complicated structure with many integrated
functions, of which only one, the user interface is visible for the end users.
<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows these components and how they
interact in the production of one result set exposed to an end user.

The components may run on a single computer,
or be distributed on several for improved performance.


</div>

<h4>Harvester</h4>

The NWI robot, the <b><i>harvester</i></b>, obtains its work
assignment from a program called <b><i>scheduler</i></b>. The
scheduler coordinates much of the work in the harvesting system.
It receives lists of URLs for harvesting and stores them internally.
When a harvester is idle, it connects to the scheduler across the network
and asks for a new URL to be harvested.

<p>

Part of scheduler's task is performed by a subsystem called
<b><i>guard</i></b> which keeps information on all URLs in a simple
database.  Guard makes decisions on whether any given URL may be retrieved,
based on two conditions:

<ul>

<li> Robot exclusion protocol [<a href="#ref17">17</a>] which is a
standardized way for web-masters to give directives to with harvesting
robots, and in particular give information on what areas on servers
that are unsuitable for indexing.

<li> That NWI should be a good netizen and neither put unnecessary
load on any server or network, nor should NWI retrieve any one URL too often.

</ul>

If the scheduler gets the proper permissions from guard it delivers
the URL to a harvester which will issue
a get-if-modified-since request for the item in question. This means
that the harvester will get the object if it has been modified since
it was last indexed by NWI. If the object has not been modified, the
server will indicate that this is the case.
<p>
While analyzing each retrieved object, the robot will also create a
list of all URLs encountered. The NWI URL-feedback cycle is completed by the
submission of this list to the scheduler for indexing. Before
submission the lists must be filtered through the policy filter to
ensure that they fulfill
the local selection criteria. Currently, this means that the objects to be
indexed have to be stored on servers located in one of the Nordic domains.

This feedback of URLs is used for resource discovery by the NWI system
and will eventually lead NWI to all (linked) pages within its domain.

<h4>Database</h4>

<p>
By default NWI does not store retrieved material in its original form.
Instead the robot creates a database record corresponding to a
catalog card in a library.

The NWI record contains detailed structured information, both inferred and extracted. Extracted information is stored in fields
corresponding to different HTML structures.  All SGML entities (as
&amp;ouml; for ö) are converted to ISO 8859-1 characters in order to
make them searchable. For examples of HTML elements extracted to
separate fields in the records see (Table 2)</p>
<!-- do you have a description of inferred data in a NWI record? - ldn -->

<p>

In order to keep up with the rapid change of the Web, the database
has to be updated continuously.  Each record has to be checked against
the corresponding object on the Net. Due to its inherent scalability
based on distribution, the NWI demonstrator is capable of checking all
4 - 5 Million pages in about 1 - 2 weeks.  In practice we do a complete round trip
in about one month.

<h2>4. Searching the NWI</h2>

<p>

The NWI user interface is accessed via the WWW.  The user may also choose to
simultaneously cross search of several regional databases, or to
restrict the search to just one.  The interface also guides the
user to the server closest to his or her site.  It is straight
forward to adapt the user interface to local conditions, for instance to
translate it to national languages.

Hence NWI today, through local efforts, has a multi-lingual user
interface, supporting five Nordic languages as well as English.
In modern WWW clients
supporting HTTP 1.1 [<a href="#ref24" >24</a>], it is possible to give a
ranked list of language preferences. That list is used for linguistic
hand shaking between client and server, which is supported in recent
versions of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
NWI also supports this way of selecting language.

<h3>4.1 The NWI user interface</h3>

<p>

The current NWI user interface supports two search modes, simple
and advanced. Below we will demonstrate these in English and Swedish.

The only options in the simple search form is the possibility to
select one or several database(s). The default configuration of simple
searches is using the Z39.50 BIB-1 attributes 4=105 and 5=101,
implying ranked search and enabling truncation. These settings might
easily be varied between countries reflecting local needs and
preferences.


</p>

<p>

The advanced interface provides the user with a fielded searching.  In
this form, users can choose between a number of fields in a pull down
&lt;select&gt; menu. Given that a user is searching for the string
<kbd>text</kbd>, the different possible interpretations of that search
are outlined in Table 3.
</p>

<p>
In addition, NWI offers an interesting scan facility in
which hyper-linked term lists sorted alphabetically are generated on-the-fly 
by the server.

The fields can be combined with with a number of boolean and proximity
operators.  Currently ``and'', ``or'', ``but not'' are supported.
Some sites also support the proximity operator ``near''. The default
operator is ``and''.

<h2>5. Current developments related to NWI</h2>

<p>
Correct handling and searching of texts in the Nordic languages goes far
beyond support for ISO8859-1.  Our goals now include the implementation of stemming support in all of the languages.  Furthermore, because most other search
services, including the Nordic ones are commercial, the Nordic Web Index
is intended to be a public service enterprise.  We see it as an
electronic counterpart to our countries National Bibliographies.</p>

<h4>NWI and metadata</h4>

<p>

Metadata awareness is implemented in collaboration with the Nordic Metadata project [<a
href="#ref10">10</a>], which aims, among other things, to make it
easier for search engines to index the Nordic Web through the use
of Metadata. Advocates for the use of metadata raises the issue:
<i>What</i> should be searchable in a Web Index?  Should it be
possible to search for author, ISBN-number, title, a historical time
period or geographical names that may be covered in, say, a thesis.
Searches of this kind are currently impossible on Internet search
engines, but are supported as matter-of-course in bibliographical 
databases and library OPACS. Why this difference?

<p>

Library OPACS keeps advanced data on data -- metadata.  Librarians
have created formal descriptions for each item in the database,
and in doing that they have followed carefully standardized procedures.  If we
want to reach similar precision when searching the Internet, then
someone will have to do that same level of description on the Net. 
The main questions become: 
Who shall do the job, and who shall pay the one doing it?  The
simplest and cheapest solution as to let the authors include this data themselves.

<p>

Dublin Core is a standardization initiative aimed at just this,
simplified description of electronic material, and it is the fruit of
discussions in a group of knowledgeable people, such as librarians,
archivists, computer scientists and others.  The problem to solve has
been to find that set attributes that can be used with a minimal
effort to describe what has been labelled as `document like'
objects.  In a series of workshops, there have been discussions on
special problems arising when describing texts, images and multimedia.
By December 1996 a consensus solution was established
comprising fifteen elements.  Although Dublin Core is not to be
regarded as a formal standard both public and private sector
organizations follow suit and acknowledge the need for a simple
metadata standard.  Other related initiatives like GILS [<a
href="#ref25">25</a>] attempt to coordinate their efforts with
DC. Dublin Core 1.0 have been documented as an "Internet draft"
[<a href="#ref16">16</a>], and
is on its way to be established as an Internet standard.

<p>

Together with the Nordic Metadata Project we have made some
measurements on the occurrence of metadata in the Swedish WWW.
Metadata are now fairly common on the Worldwide Web (Table 4).
Currently the robot only extracts embedded metadata available in html
metatags, as authors and web-masters start embedding RDF metadata [<a
href="#ref23">23</a>] we will add that to the reptoire of the parser.

<p>

Indeed we consider the occurrence of such metadata high enough to
warrant the building a metadata based search service. From the NWI we
have exported metadata from the Swedish and Danish harvesting
databases into two separate Dublin Core databases. Since only a small
proportion of the data is Dublin Core in its original form, we have
transformed the attributes found to their semantically closest Dublin
Core counterpart. The transformations that is performed depend on the
current distribution and abundance of metadata fields
[<a href="#ref31">31</a>].
The metadata is exported from the NWI database,
attributes transformed as mentioned and the result is a database with
records in SOIF format [<a href="#ref26">26</a>]. 
Those interested may inspect one example of 
HTML-encoded metadata and the resulting Dublin Core SOIF template
[<a href="#ref28">28</a>].

</p>

In creating the database the exporting software is actually filling
some gaps with inferred information. The URL were, for instance, taken
from the harvesting database rather than the metadata (after all, the
URL from the harvesting database had been verified just recently).
The resulting databases are available for testing
[<a href="#ref29" >29</a>].

<p>

The metadata searches are done using Z39.50, but in these two
databases we are experimenting with a search interface using the
extended tagset-G proposal [<a href="#ref27" >27</a>] and the BIB-1
[<a href="#ref30" >30</a>] attribute set. The mappings can be
inspected in Table 5.

<p>

There have been some discussions concerning a structuralistic and a
minimalistic approach to Dublin Core metadata. The tension between
these two camps was mostly resolved at the Canberra Dublin Core workshop
(March 1997) and implied that a Dublin Core substructure could be used to
refine the semantics of an element but must never be used to extend
its meaning. A search engine should thus be able remove all
substructure and lump all of it into the base elements. This is
exactly what we are doing in SweMeta and DanMeta.

When converting metadata generated by HTML authoring tools like MS
Frontpage and friends, this approach is mostly sufficient.  However,
the lumping of metadata can be very confusing for users. For instance,
in our minimalistic databases street names may turn up when a user
makes Z39.50 scan in the author field, because we have collapsed all
DC.Creator.Address-like fields into DC.Creator. There are other side
effects, for instance the US-MARC record syntax tend to become a bit
confusing, since the value may contain a haphazard collection of
information extracted from incompatible fields.

<h4>Subject based Web indexing</h4>

<p>

The DESIRE Web indexing technology makes it possible to create
databases based on other domains than geography and networking.  By
initializing the robot with the URLs of a number manually maintained
link collections within a given area, and proceeding two or three
steps from there, and given sufficiently high quality and coverage of
the inocculum link collection, one might this create a database
containing if not `all' resources within the area so at least those
with a high linkage.

<p> We have used this method for creating the the `All' engineering
database [<a href="#ref14">14</a>],
which is a part of the Engineering Electronic Library.
Our experience from this is that it has been a fairly straightforward task to
generate a database with tens of thousands resources, and that the
precision in searching such a database much higher than what is
achievable in a general Web index.

<h2>6. Conclusions</h2>

<ul>

<li>The Nordic Web Index currently provide open services in
Denmark (<a href="http://nwi.dtv.dk/">http://nwi.dtv.dk/</a>),
Finland (<a href="http://nwi.funet.fi/">http://nwi.funet.fi/</a>),
Iceland (<a href="http://nwi.bok.hi.is/">http://nwi.bok.hi.is/</a>),
Norway (<a href="http://nwi.bibsys.no/">http://nwi.bibsys.no/</a>)
and Sweden (<a href="http://nwi.lub.lu.se/">http://nwi.lub.lu.se/</a>).

<li>NWI databases are assets on their own right and may be used for
any non-commercial project.

<li>Within DESIRE and NWI a technology for regional Web indexing has
been developed. The resulting system is:
<ul>
<li>distributed
<li>scalable
<li>collaborative
<li>open
<li>metadata aware
<li>using open standards like Z39.50 and Dublin Core
</ul>

<li>We have been able to build a significant amount of experience in
the area. The `public service' idea of the NWI and the open
architecture enables us to contribute expertise to joint projects with
others within the public as well as public sector private.

</ul>
