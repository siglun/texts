Introduction

<p>
Metadata is, by definition, data on data.
For printed material the production of metadata,
i.e. cataloging, abstracting and indexing,
has been an important task of librarians for more a century.
Obviously it is an expensive enterprise to use trained staff for this,
and because of the volatility of the Internet the trend has been to completely
abandon metadata production,
and completely rely on full text searching.
As a consequence it is today impossible to look up <i>August Strindberg</i>
in any of the popular WWW search services
<i>and</i> restrict the search to material <i>about</i> him,
<i>or</i> to material authored <i>by</i> him.
<p>
   Although copyright issues are hot topics on the Internet,
the Hypertext Mark up Language <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
does not provide facilities for informing document users about
metadata like copyright ownership or author.
Currently document title is the only piece of information.
supported by HTML.
<p>
   This document does is not intended to provide <i>general</i> recommendations
for metadata production for electronic publications.
This is the task of other projects, such as the Nordic Metadata Project <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
Instead it is a customized proposal for the Swedish Environet.
As far as the current standardization efforts are concerned,
the state of affairs is not as stable as one would wish.
Hence parts of the solution proposed has to some extent be proprietary,
but we have largely built the package upon components that are <i>not</i>
considered controversial today.
We are confident that the solution proposed is at least fairly close to
what will be a <i>de facto</i> standard in the near future.

Dublin Core: DC--The Jack-of-all-trades/ metadata attribute set
</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE" valign=top><pre>

</pre></td><td>
<p>
Most metadata attribute sets have been proposed for the description of
one or only a few kinds of data.
They are thus optimized for providing good solutions to fairly
narrow ranges of problems.
Such a metadata system tailored for governmental information sources will be
discussed further below.
<p>
   Before we go into that particular niche,
we will briefly mention the most general of them all:
Dublin Core Set, DC for short [<a href="#ref3">3</a>,<a href="#ref4">4</a>,<a href="#ref5">5</a>].
Jack-of-all-trades is master of none;
and DC does not cover all special cases.
However, DC is optimized for ease of use in conjunction with electronic
material,
and, as we will see, for making it possible to use it as a sort
of <i>lingua franca</i> metadata attribute set.
The DC set contains only thirteen attributes (Table 1),
all of which are optional and repeatable.
The DC standardization effort, which is not yet completed,
is endorsed by most workers involved in other more specialist
standards.
<p>
<table align=center border=1 >
<caption>Table 1.
The following comprises the reference definition of the Dublin Core
Metadata Element set as of December, 1996.  The elements or their names
are not expected to change substantively from this list, though the
application of some of them are currently experimental and subject to
interpretation.  Further, it is expected that practice will evolve to
include sub-elements for certain of the elements.</caption>
<tr><th align=left>Element Lable</th><th align=left>Element Description</th></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>TITLE</td><td valign=top>The name given to the resource by the CREATOR or PUBLISHER.
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
CREATOR</td><td valign=top>
The person(s) or organization(s) primarily responsible for the
intellectual content of the resource.  For example, authors in the
case of written documents, artists, photographers, or illustrators
in the case of visual resources.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
SUBJECT</td><td valign=top>
The topic of the resource, or keywords or phrases that describe
the subject or content of the resource.  The intent of the
specification of this element is to promote the use of controlled
vocabularies and keywords.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
DESCRIPTION</td><td valign=top>
A textual description of the content of the resource, including
abstracts in the case of document-like objects or content
descriptions in the case of visual resources.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
PUBLISHER</td><td valign=top>
The entity responsible for making the resource available in its
present form, such as a publisher, a university department, or a
corporate entity. The intent of specifying this field is to
identify the entity that provides access to the resource.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
CONTRIBUTORS</td><td valign=top>
Person(s) or organization(s) in addition to those specified in the
CREATOR element who have made significant intellectual
contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary
to the individuals or entities specifed in the CREATOR element
(for example, editors, transcribers, illustrators, and
convenors).
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
DATE</td><td valign=top>
The date the resource was made available in its present form.  The
recommended best practice is an 8 digit number in the form
YYYYMMDD as defined by ANSI X3.30-1985. In this scheme, the date
element for the day this is written would be 19961203, or December
3, 1996.
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
TYPE</td><td valign=top>
The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working
paper, technical report, essay, dictionary.  It is expected that
RESOURCE TYPE will be chosen from an enumerated list of types.
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
FORMAT</td><td valign=top>
The data representation of the resource, such as text/html, ASCII,
Postscript file,  executable application, or JPEG image.  The
intent of specifying this element is to provide information
necessary to allow people or machines to make decisions about the
usability of the encoded data (what hardware and software might be
required to display or execute it, for example).
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
IDENTIFIER</td><td valign=top>
String or number used to uniquely identify the resource.  Examples
for networked resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other
globally-unique identifiers,such as International Standard
Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names would also be candidates for 
this element.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
SOURCE</td><td valign=top>
The work, either print or electronic, from which this resource is
derived, if applicable. For example, an html encoding of a
Shakespearean sonnet might identify the paper version of the
sonnet from which the electronic version was transcribed.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
LANGUAGE</td><td valign=top>
Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource.  Where practical,
the content of this field should coincide with the Z39.53 three character
codes for written languages. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
RELATION</td><td valign=top>
Relationship to other resources.  The intent of specifying this
element is to provide a means to express relationships among
resources that have formal relationships to others, but exist as
discrete resources themselves.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
COVERAGE</td><td valign=top>
The spatial locations and temporal durations characteristic of the
resource. Formal specification of COVERAGE is currently under
development. Users and developers should understand that use of
this element should be currently considered experimental.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
RIGHTS</td><td valign=top>
The content of this element is intended to be a link (a URL or
other suitable URI as appropriate) to a copyright notice, a
rights-management statement, or perhaps a server that would
provide such information in a dynamic way.
No assumptions should be made by users if such a field is empty
or not present.

<p>
The intention is that the basic DC attribute set should be easy enough to use
even for casual users.
However,
one  of the major strengths of the DC metadata system is the sub-elements <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>,
which enables organizations to produce a detailed metadata.
It is even possible accommodate metadata produced using more specialized
attributes within a DC record.
This is the case for the GILS metadata attribute set,
treated in the next section.

Governmental Information Locator Service:
GILS--The metadata attribute set for governmental information
</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE" valign=top><pre>

</pre></td><td>
<p>
The adoption the GILS metadata system by federal governmental organizations
with a few notable exceptions
(such as operational data at the Central Intelligence Agency)
is mandatory according to U.S. Public Law 44 USC 3511.
The purpose of GILS has been described as follows:
<blockquote>
<i>As part of the Federal role in the National Information Infrastructure,
GILS identifies and describes information resources
throughout the Federal government,
and provides assistance in obtaining the information.
GILS supplements other government and commercial information
dissemination mechanisms,
and uses international standards for information search and retrieval so that
information can be retrieved in a variety of ways</i>/ <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>.
</blockquote>
Although GILS originated as a federal initiative in the United States
to give the tax payers easy access to information
which collection they have funded,
there are similar initiative in many democratic countries.
And many of them are using GILS in order to facilitate interoperability.
<p>
Since GILS has a strong and enthusiastic user community among
governmental organizations world wide,
we suggest that the Swedish Enviro-Net's locator service should use
that attribute set in its main database.

Embeddable metadata
</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE" valign=top><pre>

</pre></td><td>
<p>
The are two methods of metadata delivery:
It may be delivered together with the object it describes
(like the Library of Congress and British Library records printed in many
text books today).
Or it can be found in databases.
Needless to say,
many libraries use the information provided in the printed record to create
upgraded bibliographic records.
<p>
It would be a logical step
to do the same for electronical documents,
and it is possible to embed metadata inside documents of some types.
The metadata will then reside in the document for the benefit
of robot based search services.
Although the facilities provided by HTML for the purpose are poor,
it is possible to do so using:
<dl><dt><dd>
<pre>
&lt;META NAME="SOME_ATTRIBUTE" CONTENT="SOME_VALUE"&gt;
</pre>
</dl>
The problem with this scheme has so far been that there have been few
and poorly standardized attributes available for the purpose,
and no method for providing information about the attribute sets used.
This problem has recently addressed at a workshop sponsored
by the World Wide Web Consortium <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>.
The current recommended scheme is described in Appendix A.
<p>
   For obvious reasons it is much more difficult or impossible to do so
for multi-media objects like images and sounds.
There are simple methods to avoid those problems,
and the same is true for objects that are not document like.
Swedish Enviro-Net project will provide metadata for databases,
which also fits into this category.
The workaround would be to embed metadata into that HTML document which
is carrying, the so to speak, canonical link to the object or service in
question (e.g., the databases search forms),
or to deliver multimedia objects as inlined objects,
and embed its metadata in the page in which it is inlined.
<p>
   Although it is possible to embed a GILS record directly in HTML
(see Appendix A/ for a real world example of this),
we suggest that the Swedish Enviro-Net takes the step to use DC
for this purpose.
In all but the most complex cases it will be possible to allow document
authors create DC records,
and convert these at the Enviro-Net server to GILS records <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>.
The gains of this procedure are that DC is considerably easier to use,
and that the DC community exerts a strong
pressure upon search service providers (Lycos, AltaVista etc.).
It is most likely that these services will start supporting
DC metadata before any other metadata system.
Hence there is a fair chance that the metadata produced with in
the project eventually will reach a very wide audience.

<p>
It is not unlikely that the DC/GILS combo might turnout to be wanting,
in that various kinds scientific data data collections
may call for more detailed descriptions.
An appropriate description of such data might require specialized scientific,
geospacial or biological metadata attribute sets.
There are accepted or evolving metadata standards within these areas:
The Scientific and Technical Attribute and Element Set (STAS) <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>,
FGDC <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>,
which got its name from the body that proposed it,
the Federal Geographic Data Committee,
and NBII,
National Biological Information Infrastructure <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>,
of the U.S. National Biological Survey.
Of these, the STAS and FGDC standards seem to by the most advanced
stage of development.
STAS is used by Chemical Abstracts
and the first version of FGDC is released and is used by
military (primarily the by the U.S. Navy) and governmental agencies
in the United States.
<p>
   We have no firsthand experience of using any these and are currently not
prepared to give advice,
but urge the Swedish Enviro-Net to undertake a study to assess
the needs for facilities provided by these standards within the project.

Summary of recommendations
</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE" valign=top><pre>

</pre></td><td>
<p>
The Swedish Environ-Net project has the potential to set the standards
for similar efforts in Sweden and perhaps also in the Nordic Countries.
From our point of view,
we would welcome a formal statement from the project that it will
build its information structure using open standards,
in order to facilitate interoperability.
We suggest:
<ol>
<li>The use of GILS attribute set for describing resources in
the Environet.
<li>
That metadata are produced by document authors or publishers and not
by the Environet itself.
To this end 
<li>
Most metadata should be embedded in document using DC.
This will make maintenance of the database easier,
since records may be revised together with the documents they describe.
<li>
The Environet's database will be possible to produce using a harvesting
robot.
<li>
Quality ratings, or statements can be maintained by Environet as external
metadata objects.
<li>
More detailed studies are needed on the need metadata systems with
special features.
I suggest that the Swedish Enviro-Net should
review the needs for advanced metadata formats like
FGDC, STAS and NBII metadata standards.
<li>
Although this paper does not cover the classification of resources,
it is of utmost importance for the success of the project
(if the service is to include a browseable information structure).
Again I suggest that this problem should be addressed by trained librarians
at member organizations.

The general recommended syntax for metadata embedding is to use
the HTML META tag for distributing attributes and values:
<pre>
&lt;META NAME="META_DATA_SCHEME.attribute"
	CONTENT="Value of that attribute"&gt;
</pre>
<tt></tt>Then a LINK tag is used for providing a definition of the META_DATA_SCHEME
in question:
<pre>
&lt;LINK REL="SCHEMA.META_DATA_SCHEME.attribute"
	HREF="URL to document describing the attribute"&gt;
</pre>
<tt></tt>The following is a part of a detailed DC record,
complete with links to descriptions of each attribute:
<pre>
&lt;META NAME="DC.title"
	CONTENT="(TYPE=long) Metadata for the masses:
	what is it, how can it help me, and how can I use it?"&gt;
&lt;LINK REL=SCHEMA.dc 
	HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title"&gt;

&lt;META NAME="DC.title" 
	CONTENT="(TYPE=short) Metadata for the masses"&gt;
&lt;LINK REL=SCHEMA.dc
	HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title"&gt;

&lt;META NAME="DC.subject"
	CONTENT="(SCHEME=keyword) Dublin Core,
	Metadata, Warwick Framework, Resource Description,
	Resource Discovery"&gt;

&lt;LINK REL=SCHEMA.dc 
      HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#subject"&gt;
&lt;META NAME="DC.author" CONTENT="(TYPE=name) Paul Miller"&gt;
</pre>
<tt></tt>The URLs used in the LINK tag should go to an official repository of metadata
schemes.
In the case of Dublin Core Set, such a repository has been established at
OCLC in Dublin, Ohio.
<p>
   The following is partial GILS record, which has its repository at USGS.
