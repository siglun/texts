    <h1 class="title">Digital preservation and accessiblity of Central<br />
	Asian Rare Books and Manuscripts</h1>
    
    <h1 class="level1">Background</h1>

    <p>The late Swedish diplomat Gunnar Jarring (1907-2002) was beside his
      career as a diplomate (as such he became UN secretary general's
      special envoy to the middle east) a turkologist and a specialist in
      Uighur literature.</p>

    <p>As a globetrotter and diplomat he was able to aquire large
      collections of books and manuscripts from Central Asia (mainly the
      Uzbekistan, Kirghizistan and the Xinjiang province in China). 1982 he
      donated a manuscript collection to Lund university library. It
      comprises 560 volumes, and is held to be the third largest
      collection of Uighur manuscripts in the world.</p>

    <p>About 75% of the collection is in the Uyghur language, the rest is in
      Chagatai (a now extinct language), Persian and Arabic. As of the age
      of the manuscripts, a majority of them are 19th century (please note
      that the first printer's workshop in Central Asia was established by
      Swedish missionaries in the early 20th century). The rest are from the
      16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Jarring himself wrote a preliminary
      catalogue the collection.</p>

    <p>The catalogue is handwritten in English with incipits and explicits in
      the languages of the objects. Ehrensvärd and Ekström provide a detailed
      description of the collection[1].</p>

    <p>In his donation, Jarring expressed the wish that the catalogue should
      be revised and printed. We would also want to make the manuscripts
      available in digital form in a service similar to the one we already
      provide for our medieval manuscripts[2].</p>


    <h1 class="level1">A digital library?</h1>

    <p>In order to create a digital library of this collection, we need
      collaboration with scholars from Central Asia. Both parties could
      benefit from such a project, we can trade digital library skills and
      technologies agains lingustic expertise. The overall goal would be to
      establish a digital library of cultural heritage resources in Uighur
      and other Altaic languages, such as Uzbek, of Central Asia. Such a
      resource would be valuable resource for researchers and students of
      Turkology worldwide.</p>

    <p>We envisage that such a joint project between Lund university and
      institutions there could include the following:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Provide training of scholars from Central Asia in text encoding and
	the building of digital preservation services</li>

      <li>Completion and XML encoding of Jarring's catalogue for the Lund
	collection</li>

      <li>To catalogue similar collections in Central Asia</li>

      <li>Digitization of the Lund collection and similar collections in
	Central Asia.</li>

      <li>Form a "union catalogue" of digitized manuscripts and rare books in
  Uighur and other Altaic languages</li>
    </ul>
