      <p>The market has forced the major browser manufacturers to converge on
      standards. Microsoft cannot afford to produce a browser that won't work
      on google apps, and the Linux based netbooks and netboxes make a
      difference. If <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software is a
      service</a>, what is the client? Obviously the web client, the
      browser. But why are the search engines lagging behind?  Browsers are
      capable of AJAX and advanced XML processing, but the search engines are
      still basically just removing tags and presenting raw text extracts.</p>

      <p>I have quite a few documents on this site that are written in raw
      XML, such as <a href="/2008/dighum/digital_humanities.xml">Digital
      Humanities Infrastructures</a> position paper from last year. Since it
      is about digital humanities and text encoding, I wrote it in <a
      href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI</a> XML. The paper is presented using
      client side XSLT. Just view source on that note, and you'll see my
      markup. The document is a blatant show-off; it is written in nerdcore
      vanity. At the top you'll see</p>

      <pre>
	&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
	&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="render.xsl" type="text/xsl" ?>
      </pre>

      <p>The <kbd>xml-stylesheet</kbd> processing instruction is read by your
      browsser, which then retrieves the stylesheet <a
      href="/2008/dighum/render.xsl">render.xsl</a>. Without any further ado
      it is then transformed into html for you to read.</p>

      <h2>What does Google do when indexing XML?</h2>

      <p>There is almost certainly a range of XML formats that is actually
      interpreted by Google. Which formats, well we don't know but in practice
      can hardly expect anything more exotic than common syndication formats
      (such as RSS and ATOM ), microformats and RDFa.</p>
