      <p>At the <a href="https://www.kb.dk/">Royal Library</a> we have been
      working with the building of an infrastructure for publishing of
      digitized material. It is collections of digital images, usually with
      very little textual content to go with it.</p>

      <p>The cataloging of the images has been made by library staff using the
      image database system Cumulus from <a href="https://www.canto.com/">Canto</a>.  Cumulus is designed as digital
      asset management system for people within graphical industry. Canto is
      producing an advanced Web user interface, but it is rather poor as
      regards dissemination of the collections on the web. For example, images
      published that way never ever appear in Google Images. Syndication of
      our content has not been possible, since the system have been lacking
      any concept of standardized metadata, which is essential for all
      collaboration between institutions in the library communities.</p>

      <p>To take advantage of the relative ease of use for the people handling
      the images, but still be able to provide access to our collections on
      the Internet we have an entirely new web interface. For performace
      reasons, we decided that it should <em>not</em> access the cumulus
      database directly, but a mirror in our Oracle DB. Furthermore we wanted
      a REST XML web service layer.</p>

      <p>The latter goal was achieved by using two syndication services, built
      on top of Oracle. The two services were written as JAVA servlets, and
      supported Outline Processor Markup Language (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071019150004/http://opml.org/">OPML</a>) and <a href="http://www.opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a>, together with RSS. The
      rationale for the latter choice of standard was that we wanted
      mainstream Internet Standards rather than typical library standards such
      as <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/">SRU</a>. OpenSearch is
      promoted by <a href="http://a9.com">A9</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and there are at least pledges
      of support from other big players such as Google and Yahoo.</p>

      <p>OPML was not an as obvious choice. However, OpenSearch is basically a
      Syndication protocol and as such OPML is a candidate since its most
      common usage is to provide subject structured access to feeds. An early
      version of the system is available on our web site, the first version
      was released for about a year ago. Our technology choices makes it
      stright forward to syndicate the content. The gadget on this page is an
      example of this. It is a gadget showing the OPML and RSS from the first
      collection of images released in this way, <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a>,
      a collection of historical images from a few Danish cities. The widget
      itself is "The Original Feed Widget" a nifty thing coming from <a href="http://grazr.com">grazr.com</a>. You can make one of your own by
      filling in the URI <a href="http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8">http://www.kb.dk/opml_category_service/danmarksbilleder/?opml_mode=shallow&amp;subject=8</a>
      in the form on grazr.com.</p>

      <p>The use of truly simple de facto Internet standards is one
      advantage. But we needed a way to build traditional web contents on top
      of our two web services. Sites as <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a>
      mentioned above, and its "cousins" <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/kistebilleder/">Kistebilleder</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/daellsvarehus/">Daells
      varehus</a> and <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/partiprogrammer/">Partiprogrammer</a>. All
      these are actually delivered by one single servlet, which is most
      appropriately described as a mashup-engine.</p>

      <p>The engine is written in-house, and supports multiple skins (as seen
      in the examples above -- <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/maj/danmarksbilleder/">Danmarksbilleder</a> differs from <a href="http://www.kb.dk/images/billed/2008/sep/kistebilleder/">Kistebilleder</a>).</p>

      <p>In this application a skin is a XML document, which consists of the
      lay-out for the html page (it is little more than the HTML). Appart from
      html tags it also contain &lt;kb:include/&gt; tags identified by they id
      attribute. Each kb:include tag corresponds to a REST XML web service and
      is connected to a XSLT script via configuration file. The mashup engine
      reads the skin at initialization, and upon a request it retrieves the
      required OPML or RSS, transforms the content, pastes these fragments
      into the skin DOM tree and finally delivers the content to the
      client.</p>

      <p>The mashup engine is not very well written. I can do better. Also the
      current set of services requires an Oracle schema per collection
      disseminated which is wasteful. We've haven't got the time yet to fix
      the first problem, but the second problem is about to be solved since we
      have a second generation of web services in the pipe-line for release
      real soon. In this application we've just one single Oracle database for
      all editions served. I will give you a report on that one when it is
      online.</p>
