  <summary>The problem with providing an OK Amazoogle experience is that we
  might fail in providing advanced services to patrons that have special
  needs.</summary>

      <p>By and large we in the library world have, finally, accepted the
      reality. We do no longer regard the online catalogue's poor usability as
      an <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy">information
      literacy problem</a>. As such, there was a remedy: User education. The
      roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. The path towards
      mastering the online catalogue is like a very long session in the
      gym. You feel better the day after tomorrow.</p>

      <p>After (rougly) 2003, there was a general acceptance that the our
      patrons deserved an easier to use interface, and the concept of the
      integrated library system was born. The <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog#Next-generation_catalogs">new
      kind of system</a> [obviously, a next generation system 2009 is obsolete 2021] as I correct links in these documents] should be so easy to use that new generations used to
      <a href="https://www.lorcandempsey.net/orweblog/the-sound-of-words-amazoogle-and-googlezon/">Amazoogle and
      Googlezon</a> should not be frustrated by the complications of the
      typical scanlists generated by the library opac upon the entering of a
      long and complicated query in <a
      href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Command_Language">CCL</a>.</p>

      <p>The user preferences have been known for a long time. For instance,
      all users of the <a
      href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/17/SearchUsers">Open
      Text search engine</a> used the simple form, except those that
      didn't. They used the advanced one, and they amounted to about 0.5% of
      the grand total. Such users belong to the tip of some <a
      href="https://longtail.typepad.com/">long tail</a>, and they do know what
      they want to know, but knowing that might not help if we cannot
      deliver.</p>

      <p>I heard a story from a librarian at The Royal Library. A student
      appeared at the information desk at one of our reading rooms requesting
      a list of contemporary Japanese literature translated into Danish for
      some paper in translation studies. Our nice ILS <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017131031/http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview">Primo</a>
      provides an OK Amazoogle experience. But, well... An user hostile
      boolean fielded search in the rusty old OPAC did the job.</p>

      <p>The good news is that the advanced search form is much cheaper to
      build than simple one. That one is still the real challange. Even for
      Google.</p>
