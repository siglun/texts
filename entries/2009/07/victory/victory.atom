      <p>Is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug">Smaug</a>
      resting on a pile of gold? Or a predator resting after a victorius
      battle with a powerful prey?</p>

      <p>Obviously neither. But I've seen this image before. An excavator has
      demolished a building, and has then proudly been parked on top of the
      remnants. The building was a petrol station from the sixties. I'll not
      miss it; it was an ugly building. The shop inside it was
      poor. That's not the point.</p>

      <p> The point is just <strong>why this gesture of violence</strong>? Why
      is excavator always parked on top of the remnants? Is it a gesture of
      triumph? Has the present once again earned a victory over the past? It
      is the choice of parking place which is the question.</p>
