      <p>Lorcan Dempsey of OCLC research, is involved in among lots of
      things, statistical analyses of media use. In that work he and
      his colleagues are forced to make som operational definitions of
      the 'book'. Definitions that inspired Lorcan to make some <a
      href="https://www.lorcandempsey.net/orweblog/on-books-again/">interesting
      reflections on books</a>.</p>

      <p>I once had a chat with a book historian. Her view is was that a book
      is defined by its binding. The binding is the most important part of a
      book. Without it, it's just a pile of paper.</p>

      <p>My answer was as follows: Assume that an author is writing a
      book. While working on it there is a mansuscript -- which is a computer
      file. After a year or so, the book is completed and is accepted for
      publication.</p>

      <p>In my view it is now a book. After all <em>the book has been accepted
      for publication</em>. When you send it to the printers workshop, then I
      suppose it is manuscript. On the other hand, when you download the thing
      from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a> to your kindle,
      then it's a book.</p>
