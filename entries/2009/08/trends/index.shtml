      <p>Hyunyoung Choi &amp; Hal Varian, Google Research, have claimed that
      it is possible to make <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/posted-by-hal-varian-chief-economist.html">short
      term economic forcasts</a> using analysis of search terms entered into
      the Google search engine. In particular, they have shown that there is a
      positive correlation between the search interest for terms related to
      the filing for unemployment benefits and the number of people who
      actually file for unemployment benefits. This number has previously been
      shown to be a very good predictor of a future increase in
      unemployment.</p>

      <p>The search interest for terms in the <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#cat=706&amp;geo=US&amp;cmpt=q">Welfare
      &amp; Unemployment category</a> appear to be a predictor of the number
      of people filing for benefits. I read these papers &amp; blog entries
      with great interest. The search data are easily accessible. You retrieve
      them through a search form, and you can get them in CSV, so they can be
      loaded into your favorite statistics program via excel or any
      work-alike.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Having read Choi &amp; Varian's brilliant <a href="http://reseabrch.google.com/archive/papers/initialclaimsUS.pdf">little
      paper</a> (well, I'm neither economist nor statistician, but I think
      it's good), I just had to test this data source myself.</p>

      <p>My idea was to track down effects of the recession on everyday life
      and changes in peoples views of things. It is indeed easy to find such
      correlations. <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=john%20maynard%20keynes&amp;cmpt=q">John
      Maynard Keynes</a> has experienced a formidable revival during the last
      six months or so. I had expected to see some shift in interest, where
      Karl Marx should gain Adam Smith would loose. <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=Adam%20Smith%2CKarl%20Marx&amp;cmpt=q">I
      think that there is such a trend as well.</a>.</p>

      <h2>Cross country correlation</h2>

      <p>In Denmark and Sweden we have to become members in a unemployment
      benefit society, i.e., we have to pay for an insurance policy against
      unemployment in order to get a sizeable unemployment allowance. There is
      a governmental dole as well, but that one is really so diminutive that
      it will hardly keep you from the street. Hence, we hardly get any
      benefit or allowance as some kind of charity from the other tax
      payers. You have to pay in advance through your membership in an
      <strong>a kass<em>a</em></strong> in Sweden or an <strong>a
      kass<em>e</em></strong> in Denmark.</p>

	  <small>Fig. 2. The search interest for the Danish search term 'a
	  kasse' (y axis) plotted against the corresponding Swedish 'a kassa'
	  the same week. The green line represent the least square fit. There
	  is quite some scatter but the positive correlation is highly
	  significant (n=177, t=4.252 and P<sup>***</sup>&lt;0.00004,
	  two-tailed).</small>
	</p>

      </div>

      <p>Now, these two words does not appear in any other language, and I can
      safely look up the <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=a%20%20kassa%2Ca%20kasse&amp;cmpt=q">search
      interest</a> in Google Insight for Search and be fairly sure that these
      terms are not used elsewhere. The result is depicted in Fig. 1. Note
      that for a better part of 2004 one or both columns were zero. I've
      regarded those as missing values and removed them. The same was true for
      a few datapoints representing the future. I have plotted the data as
      delivered, and it seems to me that Google applies some kind smoothing
      such as a spline function. Their graphs are much smoother than mine.</p>

      <p>It seemed to me that major peaks appeared at the same time in both
      countries. To test this I made a linear regression and correlation
      analysis. The correlation is indeed highly significant, which would
      indicate that Swedes and Danes start looking for an unemployment benefit
      society during the same periods in time. Makes sense to me. The two
      countries' economies are tightly coupled and both depend on the same
      global market.</p>

	</p>
      </div>

      <p>From what I can see, this correlation is OK theoretically. For all
      practical purposes we can regard the Swedish and Danish as taken from
      distinct populations, the only factor they have in common is time, and
      information in media about the international economic development (which
      off course include the development in the neighboring countries).</p>

      <h2>Until death do us part</h2>

      <p>The day after I had convinced myself that the Danes and Swedes
      recognize the risk for being made redundant at the same time, I read in
      a Danish news paper that the rise in unemployment was leading to an
      increase in divorce rate in Denmark. Most people can end their life
      without help of Internet.</p>

      <p>Ending a marriage is a bit more difficult. To divorce you must get in
      contact with a lawyer and applicable authorities. You need to fill in
      and sign a lot of forms. All this is something that require information,
      which users expect to find on the Internet.</p>

      <p>Table 1 shows Google's top ten list for divorce oriented search
      terms. Jon and Kate are obviously a reality TV series in the US, so this
      one reflects a voracious appetite for gossip rather than a need for
      information.</p>

      <p>Then there is a group of users who are interested in statistics, such
      as divorce rate. This won't help you to get a divorce and is purely
      factual. The same true for divorce law, but here we reach the border
      line between pure fact and pure HOWTO. It is good to know the law if you
      need a divorce, isn't it?</p>

      <p>All in all, I'd say that more than half of
      these terms are searches aiming at divorce HOWTO documents. The same is
      true for Scandinavian search terms.</p>

      <p>These considerations make it interesting enough to attempt the method
      I used for correlation above, but now for "divorce" and "unemployment
      benefit society" within each of the two countries. The Danish statistics
      is in Fig. 3-4 and the Swedish in Fig. 5-6.</p>

      <p>Danish search interest for unemployment benefit societies seemed
      lower than in Sweden (Fig. 1). Also, the Danish search interest for
      divorce "skilsmisse" is higher than for unemployment benefit societies
      "a kasse" (Fig. 3), whereas in Sweden the reverse is true. We Swedes are
      search less for "skilsmässa" than we do for "a kassa" (Fig. 4).</p>

      <p>These correlations, if real, have not, for me at least, any obvious
      interpretation. A few <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/factoid">factoids</a> as a
      background. I list them without references -- this is not a scientific
      report, but a blog entry. They my recollections from radio news and the
      daily newspapers:</p>

      <div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">

	  'skilsmisse', i.e., unemployment benefit society' and 'divorce',

	</p>

      </div>

      <p><strong>i.</strong> Denmark had a lower unemployment before the
      current recession than had Sweden. This is still true. We have
      good reasons to look for a good unemployment benefit society.</p>

      <p><strong>ii.</strong> In Sweden the unemployment is biased such as it
      affects larger degree affects males than females. This is due to the
      crisis within the automobile industries we imported from the other side
      of the Atlantic.</p>

      <p><strong>iii.</strong> The Danish divorce rate 2.92 per 1000
      inhabitants) is higher than the one in Sweden (2.24). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography">Both figures from
      2004</a>.</p>

      <p>It could be possible to understand the different correlations in Figs
      4 and 6 in the light of these three factoids. It would help if there is
      an asymmetry between males and females, such that the latter are a bit
      more mercyful towards their unhappy unemployed spouses than are the
      former. I.e., if Swedish women think somewhat like: <em>Well, I want to
      leave the bastard, but I don't have to do it this week when he's so
      miserable. I'll search for "skilsmässa" in Google later on.</em></p>

      <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

      <p>First and formost I wish to point out that the analyses in this blog
      entry are made by someone who has forgotten most, if not all, the theory
      behind statistical inference. I've not performed any serious statistical
      analysis for more than fifteen years. In addition the fact that my
      knowledge about statistical inference has decayed to below a statistics
      101 level, I've never worked with proper time series analysis. I fear that
      not any of my tests here would hold a critical analysis by a
      professional. To make sense, the divorce analysis require some kind of
      time lag. You don't become member of an unemployment benefit society the
      same week your spouse get fed up with you because of your bad
      unemployment temper. The latter comes later.</p>

      <p>Anyway, the purpose of this note wasn't to make a really serious
      analysis <em>per se</em>, but to explore Google's claims that one could
      use search data for serious work. I think they are right. These data are
      available for free; you can test an idea in a few days and then decide
      what more experimental &amp; survey kind of data you'll need to make a
      test your hypotheses.</p>

      <h2>PS</h2>

      <p>There are more to say about this.</p>

      <p>Unemployment is no fun. The fact that unemployment can break marriges
      doesn't worry me too much. However, some people <a href="http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/2009071635221/academia-and-research/rise-in-unemployment-linked-to-suicide-rate.html">cannot
      live with unemployment</a>. That is much worse.</p>

      <p>Obviously there are companies out there subscribing to terms related
      to suicide, depression, drug abuse, alcoholism and the like as
      adwords. A superficial look at the ads appearing in relations to such
      searches doesn't convince me that people who search for help this way
      necessarily get the best professional help available.</p>

      <p>There is a lot to do in this area. There are a many of governmental
      and charitable organizations that do great work. Serious mental problems
      should not be treated by quacks, and the subscription to adwords related
      to such terms should, in my view, not be available to just anyone. I'm
      not even sure that I think it is a good idea that pharmaceutical
      industries should sell their drugs this way.</p>
