      <p>Dear Reader!</p>

      <p>I've got <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SigfridLundbergsStuff?format=xml">a
      new URI</a> for my ATOM feed. I appologize for the inconvenience. This
      entry will be the only one available at the original one. Feed burner
      provides so many advantages that I cannot ignore them. Just click on the
      link above and subscribe, and you'll get my scribbles as usual. However,
      I've got another new feature as well.</p>

      <p>The really substantial responses I've got on this site I got from my
      <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/jacob.shtml">colleague
      Jacob</a> and <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/images/Gertrud_berger.shtml">my wife
      Gertrud</a></p>

      <p>Both agree that my note on <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/07/commuting/">commuting
      is brilliant</a>. I'm grateful for that, but as far I can tell from the
      download stats, they are the only ones who like it. Then Jacob told me I
      ought to have a forum for discussions in relation to my scribbles. Well,
      then... I've added one of those nifty javascript based ones, <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus.com</a>. Then Gertrud said: You'll
      never find the time to moderate that. We'll see.</p>

      <p>I guess it's more likely that it will be yet another of those
      pathetic empty discussion things on the net.</p>
