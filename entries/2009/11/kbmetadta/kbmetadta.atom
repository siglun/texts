  <summary>Today I gave a presentation on our metadata work. My experience of
  that turned out to be about images.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">

      <p>Today I gave a presentation on our metadata work. It was meant to be
      about METS and MODS, but it became more of a justification for our work
      than about. As usual I had <a
      href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2009/nov30/presentation.xml">too many
      slides</a>. My main idea was to use google images instead of slides, but
      then I had to add some slides anyway because the navigation overhead was
      too high and I had difficulties to remember which images to click on.</p>

      <p>The google searches are interesting. The visual result sets give you
      an overview very different from the text search. The visual search
      engines (see, for example <a href="http://www.search-cube.com/">Search
      Cube</a>) base their navigation on some kind of canned screen dumps.
      That's nice but it isn't the images produced by the author, but an image
      of the text.</p>

      <p>Please find below an annotated list of links to searches I like:</p>

      <div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/"
	   title="Architecture of the worldwide web"><img src="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/webarch-20041021/uri-res-rep.png" width="90%" border="0" alt="URI &amp; representations &amp; resources"/></a>
	<p><small>Figure 1</small></p>

      </div>

      <h2><a
      href="http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=architecture+of+the+worldwide+web&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=&amp;start=0">Architecture of the worldwide web</a></h2>

      <p>First hit is Figure 1, from <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">the appropriate W3
      recommendation</a>. Then there are fifteen polar bears belonging to the
      cover of <q>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</q>, a title
      that I think I should read when I get the opportunity.</p>

      <h2><a
      href="http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=1&amp;q=library+catalog&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1&amp;start=0">Library
      catalog</a></h2>

      <p>This one isn't as spectacular as the architecture, but it
      gives you an idea on what people know and believe they know when it
      comes to what libraries and cataloging is about.</p>

      <div style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left:0.5em;margin-right:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://www.library.nd.edu/daiad/morgan/musings/ngc/"
	   title="Eric Lease Morgan's musings on next generation catalog">
	  <img src="http://www.library.nd.edu/daiad/morgan/musings/ngc/ngo.gif"
	       width="100%" border="0" alt="Eric Lease Morgan's musings on next generation catalog"/>
	  </a>

      </div>

      <p>There is a wonderful image (Figure 2) showing what we were all
      thinking about around 2006. When I think of it, we still are. The range
      of protocols to support, and the list of metadata formats are the
      same. The ideas doesn't change that fast.</p>

      <h2><a href='http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;q=circulation+desk&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20'>Circulation desk</a></h2>

      <p>All libraries I know have a circulation desk. Searching for it in
      Google images yields 978000 hits. Adding quotation marks reduces the
      number to 34400. None of them are particularly interesting, except
      perhaps the one at <a
      href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/army_arch/2691906687/">Doheny
      Library</a>.</p>

      <p>My fascination is more due to fact that they are all there, all these
      desks. I mean, how interesting is a circulation desk?</p>

      <h2><a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=work+expression+manifestation+item&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=">work expression manifestation item</a></h2>

      <p>This one hard core information science. <em>Work</em> is the
      ontological work, before it is expressed in a manuscript. The platonic
      blog entry, before it hits the web.</p>

      <p>There are other hard core ones, such as <a
      href="http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=1&amp;q=collect+preserve+organize+provide+access&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=&amp;start=0">collect
      preserve organize provide access</a>. As a <a
      href="http://www.google.com/search?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;q=collect%20preserve%20organize%20provide%20access&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw&amp;start=0">web
      search</a>, it yields hits mainly in library &amp; archive mission
      statements.</p>
