  <title>My first serious experience with ATOM</title>
  <link href="/entries/2009/06/atom/"/>
  <summary>You don't really understand a document format until you've manually
  encoded some documents, and written the software to parse and use it for
  something useful. This somewhat refurbished version of my web site is to a
  large extent built upon the ATOM syndication format, and here I discuss my
  experience.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

      <p>The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">ATOM syndication
      format</a> has been around for almost five years. In comparison with the
      diverse fauna kept in the menagerie abbreviated to the three character
      acronym RSS, ATOM is a well kept standard and much more useful as
      well.</p>

      <p>Now, I've used ATOM before refurbishing my personal web site, but I
      haven't used <em>seriously</em>. That is, I haven't manually encoded a
      sizeable amount of text in it, validated the result, and then written
      software using the data. ATOM is the fundament for this site, since the
      data used for generating the navigation system is encoded that way. I
      may return to that later on.</p>

      <h2>Designed for success</h2>

      <p>Tim Bray lists and provide a thorough discussion of a number of
      characteristics shared by successful mark-up languages (see his article
      <a
      href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070126140434/www.idealliance.org/proceedings/xml05/ship/175/xml2005.HTML">On
      Language Creation</a>). The list of success critera includes items such
      as extensibility, clever but not too extensive use of XML name spaces,
      the posibility of implementing the language using many, widely different,
      datamodels. From Bray's perspective, ATOM seems designed for success. I
      don't know the statistics concerning syndication format popularity, but
      if ATOM isn't yet the leader, it will become sooner or later. Possibly
      in RDF disguise.</p>

      <p>From a modelling point of view there is a few, annoying
      inconsistencies. Let us, for example, compare the <kbd>&lt;author></kbd>
      element with the <kbd>&lt;title></kbd> element. A resource may have an
      author, then the author may have a number of properties, such as a name,
      an email address and a home page. The <kbd>author</kbd> for this note is
      encoded as:</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;author>
    &lt;name>Sigfrid Lundberg&lt;/name>
    &lt;uri>http://www.sigfrid-lundberg.se/&lt;/uri>
  &lt;/author>
      </pre>

      <p>This is, in my view, a sign of good content modelling when it comes
      to metadata. A resource may have a title. A title may have different
      components, for example main title and sub-title. The main and sub parts
      are properties of the title, not of the resource. The authors of the
      ATOM spec did not see that way. A feed may have both. This is annoying
      for semantic puristic nerd like me. Entries, however, may not have
      sub-titles at all, which in my view is an inconsistency as well.</p>

      <p>The biggest flaw is the encoding of category data. A resource belongs
      to a category, i.e., this membership is a property of the resource. The
      category may have an identifier and a name, and this name is different
      depending to language. However, ATOM forces me to use the following
      construct</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;category xml:lang="en" label="structuralwebdesign" term="Structural web design" />
  &lt;category xml:lang="sv" label="structuralwebdesign" term="Structurell webbdesign" />
      </pre>

      <p>which in my view is less than excellent. I would have preferred
      something like</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;category label="structuralwebdesign">
    &lt;name xml:lang="en">Structural web design&lt;/name>
    &lt;name xml:lang="sv">Strukturell webbdesign&lt;/name>
  &lt;/category>
      </pre>

      <p>These are shortcomings, but I can live with them. But expect changes
      in this area. The semantic web is here already, and with <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> becoming a de facto
      standard on the internet, the syntactic communities will have to come up
      with something more clever for categorization of syndicated web
      resources.</p>
