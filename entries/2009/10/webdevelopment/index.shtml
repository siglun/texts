      <p>Anyone who has stayed in the same business for some years, have seen
      the recurrent changes in fashion. You'll also experience how people try
      to sell you the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_black_dress">little black
      dress</a> as something new. People invent a lot of things. Some of them
      are not that innovative. Some ideas required further development before
      they could take off. Some ideas were right, but the time wasn't.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/10/14/OOW-Take-aways#p-2">legacy</a>
      is something that is accumululating behind you. What someone (usually
      someone else) acquired or developed. You don't like the legacy, in
      particular not its documentation, but you have to maintain it.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time just about every script on the internet was written
      in the PERL programming language. Then just about every introductory
      programming course choose java as the prime example of an OO
      language. Just about any project should have some object oriented
      modelling, and J2EE was the name of the game. There were noone available
      for the legacy.</p>

      <h2>The HECS platforms</h2>

      <p>Then things happen again. PHP had been there all along. Many of the
      largest sites hade been using it for years for front-end work. The
      back-end could be written in JAVA but C, C++, perl and python are
      used. For newer sites there are languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, H and E in HECS. The remaining
      characters are C as in <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and S
      for <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></p>

      <p>Mankind is stratified into those who are early adopters and those
      that are more hesitant. Some of the early adopters buy the little black
      dress over and over again. In a sense I belong to the hesitant ones;
      novelty per se does not add to my interest. On the other hand I can get
      very enthusiastic to learn about ideas and technologies that I find
      elegant and new <em>to me</em>. One such idea, which is a true design
      classic, is functional programming. It isn't strictly speaking new to
      me. I've studied the Scheme programming language, and I'm using
      XSLT and Xquery.</p>

      <p>I'm very impressed by the elegance of the Haskell programming
      language, and the community that has been built around it. <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> is Haskell's answer to
      PERL's <a href="http://cpan.org/">cpan</a>, PHP's <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> and Python's <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a>. The Haskell developers
      seems to be most advanced when it comes to building an open-source
      community. I do believe that Erlang is the platform which has the best
      track record; it has been used in Ericsson's Open Telecom Platform, for
      building ATM switches, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">couchDB</a>
      -- a modern cloud computing classic.</p>

      <p>Still, I'm going for Haskell. I want a language which isn't using any
      virtual machine. The <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Referential_transparency">referential
      transparency</a> (purity) is just a wonderful idea. I want something
      really new and elegant, such as a little black dress.</p>
