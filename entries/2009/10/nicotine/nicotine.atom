      <p>The last few weeks I've not felt as good as I used to. As a matter of
      fact I've been really miserable.</p>

      <p>It started in August. You see, when I was about to complete any
      substantial <a
      href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/">piece of
      work or project</a>, I looked forward to the delivery with certain level
      of <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_disorder">separation
      anxiety</a>. And then, after all deliverables were completed and a new
      <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2009/08/opensearch/">service
      was in place</a>, I got a <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">postpartum
      depression</a>.</p>

      <p>This autumn all this was aggravated by severe <a
      href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000953.htm">nicotine
      withdrawal</a> symptoms. I'd say, don't even try giving up <a
      href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7ljAYX6kE">wet snuff</a>, unless
      you've prepared yourself for a passage through hell.</p>
