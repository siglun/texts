  <title>The Copenhagen cholera epidemic 1853 in contemporary
Danish newspaper prose: Some back-of-an-envelope calculations</title>
  <link href="/entries/2022/12/cholera/"/>
  <summary>Inspired by the fact that we were all hiding away from the
  Covid-19 2020 â€“ 2021, I wanted to take a closer look at some other
  epidemic. My hope was to find patterns of change in lan- guage use
  mirroring sentiments and attitudes expressed in words, bigrams and
  trigrams and frequency distributions. I started to write this May
  2020 and completed it about two years later.</summary>

      <p>A tentative analysis of how the cholera epidemic 1853 is covered
      in contemporary Danish newspapers. Words related to the
      epidemics increases rapidly in frequency at the outbreaks, but
      decreases much more slowly. Obviously the public was not
      prepared for the appearance, but the discussions of the outbreak
      continues several years after. The temporal distribution of
      trigrams containing locations (likec holerainplace name) and
      temporal info (lik ec holera er,harorhavde, i.e., is, has and
      had follo wed by some word, often an adjective) follow the
      outbreak as well.</p>
