      <p>Waldermar Lundberg, my father was born 1915. He was a printer and
      typographer and established a small workshop around 1947. The images
      here show some of the equipment he kept after his retirement 1975. He
      continued to work with printing and bookbinding until his death
      2007.</p>

      <p>Ariella was used for printing flyers and stuff.</p>

      <p>All types were stored in rack cabinets like this. My father had a 
      fairly complete set of Berling Antiqua, designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Erik_Forsberg">Karl-Erik
      Forsberg</a> (1914-1995) in the 1950s and produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berling_Type_Foundry">Berling type
      foundry</a> here in Lund until 1980, when the company ended its more than 170
      years in the graphical industry. The Berling Type Foundry was
      established in Copenhagen 1750 and continued its business there until
      1783. It was then reestablished in Lund 1837.</p>

      </div>

      <p>After his retirement he worked here for about thirty years. Father
      had various printing presses including a large modern offset press. He
      kept these two old vintage tabletop printing presses until his death. He
      inherited one from a colleague and the other had been in his possesion
      since the 1940s.</p>

      <p>This matrix is for printing a text on a book spine in one of the
      printing presses. They are the last words typeset by my father.</p>
