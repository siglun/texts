      <p>On my way home today I realized that something essential was missing.</p>

      <p>The stout.</p>

      <p>The real Irish one. Not an ordinary Swedish porter, or even an
      Imperial Stout from from Amager Bryghus.</p>

      <p>The temporal circumstances wouldn't permit a pub; possibly just about
      an off licence.</p>

      <p>I won't ask you the obvious question today: How many bottles of
      Guinness do you think were available on the-off-licence-on-my-way-home.
      I acquired a bottle of Imperial Stout. By the way, it was from Amager
      Bryghus. Not bad at all.</p>

      <p>Happy St Patrick's day!</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
