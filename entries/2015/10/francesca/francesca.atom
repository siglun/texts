  <title>Are the Ways of Seeing Francesca Woodman and Edith Gowin the
  same?</title>
  <link href="/entries/2015/10/francesca/"/>

  <summary>Francesca Woodman's work is on exhibition in Stockholm. I look at
  her photography, and felt that I had to reread parts of John Berger's ways
  of seeing.</summary>

      <p>Francesca Woodman took her life 1981 at 22 years of age. By then she
      had become a serious, hardworking and extremely skilled artistic
      photographer. She had started her exploration of art photography when
      she was 13. When considering these early works, we are talking of a
      serious endeavour of a precocious, talented teenager, not a child's
      play.</p>

      <p>Much of her work is self portraiture, and often she portrays herself
      naked. There are several female photographers who have earned well-deserved
      fame for (among other things) photographing naked humans, such as Imogen
      Cunningham and Ruth Bernard. They both depicted naked women, but as far
      as I know, neither Cunningham nor Bernard portrayed themselves, with or
      without clothes.</p>

      <p>Francesca Woodman's work is on exhibition at Moderna Museet,
      Stockholm.  According to Anna Tellgren, the curator, the reason why
      Woodman used herself as model was just practical<a
      href="note0"><sup>1</sup></a>. She was there when she needed a
      model. The cost was lower and there were no problems with model release
      contracts. I am sure there is more to than that. Since Francesca
      Woodman, Cindy Sherman and several contemporaries, the interest in this
      kind of self-portraiture has increased and is now a fairly common
      genre. I think it is much more common among women than men. This text is
      about my attempt to understand that difference.</p>

      <p>The only things I know about Edith Gowin is that she is a beautiful
      woman and that her husband is photographer Emmet Gowin. He is a well
      known photographer who earned much of his fame for his portraits of his
      often scantily clad or naked wife. The two have now celebrated their
      golden wedding anniversary since several years. In the interviews you
      find of them (for example) YouTube they seem to be still a loving
      couple. However, it might be that Emmet don't take as many photographs
      of Edith now as he did 40-50 years ago.</p>

      <p>Emmet Gowin is not alone. There are other husband photographers of
      taking photos of their wives that go far beyond the average such as
      Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946) portraits of Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986)
      which arose from an intense love story and relation. <sup><a
      href="#note1">2</a></sup> Edward Weston shot countless of nudes, of
      which, according to Robert Adams, most are fairly uninteresting:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p><em>With the exception of two full length nudes of Tina Modotti and five
	of Charis Wilson in the Oceano dunes (not many, considering the number
	of nudes Weston took), the pictures that supposedly resulted from
	Weston's love for his subjects are relative to the rest of his life's
	work, unsuccessful; they are cold to the point of being dead.</em>
	<a href="#note2"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>These photos are to be found on many web sites. Suitable searches in
      Google images:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Edward Westons <a href="https://goo.gl/dGVnjY">portraits of Charis
	Wilson</a></li>
	<li>His photos of <a href="https://goo.gl/W6BvZm">Tina
	Modotti</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://goo.gl/p4jJhA">Alfred Stieglitz' of Georgia
	O'Keeffe</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many photos of lesser artists than Weston Stieglitz and Gowin deserve
      even less praise.  It might be that most such pictures shouldn't really
      have been taken.</p>

      <p>One of the best, earliest and still extremely influential theoretical
      analyses of the nude in western art is in <em>Ways of seeing</em> by
      John Berger<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>. His arguments can be
      summarized in contrasting statements. For example:</p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>Men survey</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>Women are the surveyed</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>p. 46</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Men act</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>Women appear</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>p. 47</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Men look at women.</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>Women watch themselves being looked at.</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>p. 47</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>To be naked is to be oneself</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>To be nude is to be seen as naked by others and yet not
	  recognized for oneself</td>
	  <td><kbd> </kbd></td>
	  <td>p. 54</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>Berger argues that to be naked is to be without disguise, and to be
      nude is to be on display, to carry an disguise without clothes; to be
      condemned to never be naked. I could go on giving examples Berger's
      treatment. What interests me is not the mainstream though. Not all those
      <q>hundreds of thousands</q> of nude oil paintings and perhaps millions
      of photographs that fit the cliches described. I'm rather interested in
      those few houndreds exceptions that do not.</p>
