      <p>In all Lucky Luke stories, the cowboy jumps Jolly Jumper and rides
      towards the sunset. He could, for instance, ride along Christian's
      Brygge, pass Ny Kredit and Marriott hotel, Copenhagen, continue straight
      ahead on Kalvebod Brygge towards the sunset.</p>

      <p>I doubt that he would be able to convince Jolly Jumper to climb a hot
      air balloon gondola, and dissappear over the sedimentation dam at Lund
      sewage treatment plant.</p>

      <p>However, the photos have something round in the upper right
      corner. The sun over Copenhagen or a balloon in Lund. The similarity
      doesn't end there, though. The is a tree lined dirt road going from
      right to left in Lund, and a bridge in Copenhagen. The is a small
      vessel, the harbour bus, in Copenhagen and a water fowl in Lund.</p>

      <p>Almost all elements are present in both photos. Including air
      pollution in Copenhagen and water pollution in Lund.</p>
