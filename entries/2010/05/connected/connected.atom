  <title>Why do I keep this site?</title>

  <summary>Having had a web site for about 15 years, I start to wonder why I
  keep it in the first place.</summary>

Thursday morning. A clock went off in the bedroom. Very early. It was the calendar prompting me to attend a whole day event. The tablet synchronizes calendar entries from my outlook calendar. Very nifty, I'd say. "What was that?" my wife asked. "Oh, it was just  my calendar", I answered.

Yesterday she heard a pling from my left pocket. "An SMS?" she enquired. "Nope, an e-mail!" said I. "The alerts differ".

I stand in the kitchen, by the stove, cooking.  I write while waiting for something, typing phrenetically on my tablet. "What are you doing?" says she. "I'm just writing a text on my life as being connected."
