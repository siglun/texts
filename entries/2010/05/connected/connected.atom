  <summary>The new smartphone/tablet computer intervenes in my life, sometimes
  annoying me, but more often my wife and other people</summary>

      <p>Thursday morning. A clock went off in the bedroom. Very early. It was
      the calendar prompting me to attend a whole day event. The tablet
      synchronizes calendar entries from my outlook calendar. Very nifty, I'd
      say. <q>What was that?</q> my wife asked. <q>Oh, it was just my
      calendar,</q> I answered. <q>The standard 18
      hrs</q></p>

      <p>Yesterday she heard a pling from my left pocket. <q>An SMS?</q> she
      enquired. <q>Nope, an e-mail!</q> said I. <q>The alerts differ.</q></p>

      <p>I stand in the kitchen, by the stove, cooking.  I write while waiting
      for something to get ready, typing with frenzy on my tablet. <q>What are
      you up to?</q> asks she. <q>I'm just writing a text on my life as being
      connected.</q></p>
