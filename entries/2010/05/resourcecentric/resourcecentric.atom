      <p>I've been publishing entries here under a general heading Readings on
      Digital Objects. This text will not be the last entry in that series,
      but you should not expect many more in the near future.</p>

      <p>Scholars as well as the general public consume digital objects en
      mass. The range of digital genres on the menu is broad, covering
      everything between Worlds of Warcraft and Shakespeare's Sonnets. An
      object delivered on the net via a library (in the broadest sense of the
      word) is a digital library object. Those who have followed this series
      have realized that the discussion on what kind of data a digital library
      object should contain has been going on for more than a decade and
      possibly almost two.</p>

      <p>From very early stage, the vision within the library communities has
      been to move the library to the Internet and particularly to the
      Web. The trend to be present <q>where the users are</q> has been
      hysterical at times with libraries spending a lot on being present in
      second life and Facebook.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the tactic has been the creation of repositories. We do
      now see now a shift from the repository as the gravitational center
      towards the objects, the resources, themselves. There should be no need
      to <strong>go to the</strong> digital library and search in what is
      basically hidden web. Rather the content should be on the Worldwide Web
      and available in the mainstream search engines.</p>

      <p>Lagoze et al. (2008) use this shift of emphasis as justification for
      proposal of the new standard OAI-ORE. They formulate the new trend in a
      very clear way:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>It [the OAI-ORE standard] also reflects a recognition of the
	position of digital libraries vis-à-vis the Web that sometimes seem to
	co-exist in a curiously parallel conceptual and architectural
	space.</p>

	<p>We exist in a world where information is synonymous not with
	'library' but with the Web and the applications that are rooted in
	it. In this world, the Web Architecture is the lingua franca for
	information interoperability, and applications such as most digital
	libraries must exist within the capabilities and constraints of that
	Web Architecture.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Implementors of digital library objects have often successfully put
      the library collections on the web. They are also successfully
      disseminating simple bibliographical metadata (for example using
      OAI). Libraries have, however, been less successful as regards putting
      the objects on the Web (Lagoze, op. cit.)</p>

      <p>Another point of failure is that we have yet been incapable of
      producing interoperable objects. Or, as McDonough (2008) puts it:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>Hence XML's similarity to a rope. Like a rope, it is
	extraordinarily flexible; unfortunately, just as with rope, that
	flexibility makes it all too easy to hang yourself.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Maly and Nelson (1999) make distinctions between Dumb and Smart
      Archives and Dumb and Smart Archives, leading to four architectures
      DODA, SODA, DOSA and SOSA. Ever since, object oriented developers have
      concentrated on the SODA model (Smart Objects in a Dumb archive. Fedora
      is intended as an implementation of that.</p>

      <p>I think it is time to give attention to the DODA architecture. Then
      the all inferencing and intelligence is deferred to an independent
      indexing agent which behaves more or less like an Internet search engine
      through clever indexing and automatic text analysis.</p>
