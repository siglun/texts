      <p>This is a portrait of a lens I've kept since I was a teenager. You
      can see it in <a
      href="https://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/#nikkorO">an
      earlier entry</a>. There are quite a few web sites from Nikon F
      aficionados, such as Richard de Stoutz' <a
      href="https://www.destoutz.ch/nikon-f.html">Nikon F Collection &amp;
      Typology</a> who owns an almost <a
      href="https://www.destoutz.ch/lenses_wideangle_35mm_f2.html">complete
      series of the lens</a> and experienced professional users such as <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_surv.html">Bjørn
      Rørslett</a>. who owns <q>some 100 lenses</q> and give ratings a lot of
      them, including Nikon F <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_wide.html">wide angle
      ones</a>. This particular lens gets rating 5 for for traditional use
      with film and 4 otherwise. 5 is the highest rating and means:</p>

	<p>
	  <small>I took this photo of Angel's trumpet, <em>Brugmansia
	  suaveolens</em>, in the garden of Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. This plant
	  is as beautyful as it is extremely poisonous.</small>

      <blockquote>
	<p><em>Excellent. Use such lenses as often as possible and let other
	people wonder about the quality you can achieve with them.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      

      <p>The rating 4 means <q>Very good, quality results can be
      expected. Such lenses can safely be applied to professional
      photography.</q> I leave it to Bjørn, Richard and others to achieve the
      quality people will wonder about. A lens is an artist's tool, and the
      quality of the result depends on his or her skills.</p>

      <p>Be that as it may; a survey on <a href="https://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
      shows that you can get one of these for between $20 and $100, depending
      on whether the previous owners have used it <q>as often as possible</q>
      or not. If you're lucky and get it from someone who didn't understand
      just how good this lens is, then it is a bargain. Promise.</p>

      <p>Initially, I found it extremely hard to focus this lens. The first
      time I felt that I got almost right was when I took the photo the
      Angel's trumpet. The lens has a minimum distance of less than 30cm so you
      can use it for macro photography. And as you can see, it has a nice <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> with the aperture
      wide open.</p>

	     alt="PA202470.JPG" />
	</a>
	<p>
	  <small>Taken hand-held on my way home from the Old Bull. The lens is
	  wide open and it is night and the first winter mix is falling.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>The lens is fast, if not ultra-fast. I mean it isn't <a
      href="https://www.adorama.com/lc50095mn.html">Noctilux 50mm f0.95 at
      $10,000</a>, Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f1.1 or even any of all the f1.4
      around.</p>

      <p>The speed of the lens makes the depth of field quite small, and that
      does actually make it easier to focus. Just focus wide open¸ and then
      lessen aperture to something where your target is sharp. Then you get
      nice images for around $50.</p>

	  <small>This is an early morning in my life as an <a
	  href="/entries/2009/07/commuting/">international
	  commuter</a>. It happens now and then that the train from Lund to
	  Copenhagen is cancelled from Malmö. Then you have to wait for the
	  next train from Lund to Malmö and spend twenty minutes
	  philosophizing around this special case of the <a
	  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodice_problem">theodicé
	  problem</a>: How can there exist a good God, when I could have
	  stayed in another twenty minutes in bed.</small>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <small>Since you cannot go to bed you can just as well just look
	  across the channel, towards the old city of Malmö. Which is, quite
	  nice. Why not take a photograph of it?</small>
