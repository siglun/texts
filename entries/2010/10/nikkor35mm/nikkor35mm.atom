      <p>This is a portrait of a lens I've kept since I was a teenager. You
      can see it in <a
      href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/#nikkorO">an
      earlier entry</a>. There are quite a few web sites from Nikon F
      aficionados, such as Richard de Stoutz' <a
      href="http://www.destoutz.ch/nikon-f.html">Nikon F Collection &amp;
      Typology</a> who owns an almost <a
      href="http://www.destoutz.ch/lenses_wideangle_35mm_f2.html">complete
      series of the lens</a> and experienced professional users such as <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_surv.html">Bjørn
      Rørslett</a>. who owns <q>some 100 lenses</q> and give ratings a lot of
      lenses including Nikon F <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_wide.html">wide angle
      ones</a>.</p>

      <p>Bjørn gives this lens rating 5 for use with film based cameras
      and 4 otherwise (digital photography). 5 is the highest score on his
      list, and it implies:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p><em>Excellent. Use such lenses as often as possible and let other
	people wonder about the quality you can achieve with them.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I leave it to Bjørn and others to achieve quality people will wonder
      about. A lens is an artist's tool, and the quality of the result depends
      on his or her skills. Be that as it may; a survey on <a
      href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> shows that you can get one of them
      for between $20 and $100, depending on whether the previous owner has
      used it <q>as often as possible</q> or not.</p>
