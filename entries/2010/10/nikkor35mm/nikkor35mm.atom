      <p>This is a portrait of a lens I've kept since I was a teenager. You
      can see it in <a
      href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/08/m43/#nikkorO">an
      earlier entry</a>. There are quite a few web sites from Nikon F
      aficionados, such as Richard de Stoutz' <a
      href="http://www.destoutz.ch/nikon-f.html">Nikon F Collection &amp;
      Typology</a> who owns an almost <a
      href="http://www.destoutz.ch/lenses_wideangle_35mm_f2.html">complete
      series of the lens</a> and experienced professional users such as <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_surv.html">Bjørn
      Rørslett</a>. who owns <q>some 100 lenses</q> and give ratings a lot of
      lenses including Nikon F <a
      href="http://www.naturfotograf.com/lens_wide.html">wide angle
      ones</a>. This particular lens gets rating 5 for for traditional use
      with film and 4 otherwise. 5 is the highest rating and means:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<p><em>Excellent. Use such lenses as often as possible and let other
	people wonder about the quality you can achieve with them.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I leave it to Bjørn and others to achieve the quality people will
      wonder about. A lens is an artist's tool, and the quality of the result
      depends on his or her skills. Be that as it may; a survey on <a
      href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> shows that you can get one of these
      for between $20 and $100, depending on whether the previous owners have
      used it <q>as often as possible</q> or not. If you're lucky and get it
      from someone who hasn't understood just how good it is then it is a
      bargain. Promise.</p>

      <p>I have found it extremely hard to focus using this lens. The first
      time I felt that I got almost right was when I took the photo the
      Angel's trumpet. The lens has a minum distance of about 35cm so you can
      use it for macro photography. And as you can see, it has a nice bokeh
      whith the aperture wide open.</p>

	  <small>Taken hand-held on my way home from the Old Bull. The lens is
	  wide open and it is night and the first winter mix is falling.</small>
	</p>
      </div>

      <p>The lens is fast, if not ultra-fast. I mean it isn't <a
      href="http://www.adorama.com/LC50095MN.html">Noctilux 50mm f0.95 at
      $10,000</a>, Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f1.1 or even any of all the f1.4
      around.</p>

      <p>The speed of the lens makes the depth of field quite small, and that
      does actually make it easier to focus. Just focus wide open¸ and then
      lessen aperture to something that is safe. Then you get nice sharp
      images for around $50.</p>

	  <small>This is early morning and in my life as an <a

	  commuter</a> it happens now and then that the train from Lund to

	  minutes.</small>
