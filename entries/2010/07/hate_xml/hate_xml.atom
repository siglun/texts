Do you hate XML?

I cannot recall that I've ever written somewhere that I hate someone or even something.  I feel that hatred is emotional and irrational. It may be a difference between languages and cultures; to hate something might be more serious in Scandinavia than the anglo-american sphere, and it may also be a question of age.  When you're middle-aged you may not think it's appropriate to hate things, or at least you may not think that it's appropriate to formulate your dislike as hatred.


Chrisâ€™s big beef with XML is that XML must be processed in isolation, using special purpose tools and languages such as XSLT. In order to use these special things, developers must become domain experts in a rich and complex space that is essentially unrelated to the application itself.
