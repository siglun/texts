      <p>I cannot recall that I've ever written somewhere that I hate someone
      or even something.  I feel that hatred is emotional and irrational. It
      may be a difference between languages and cultures; to hate something
      might be more serious in Scandinavia than the anglo-american sphere, and
      it may also be a question of age.  When you're middle-aged you may not
      think it's appropriate to hate things, or at least you may not think
      that it's appropriate to formulate your dislike as hatred.</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Chrisâ€™s big beef with XML is that XML must be processed in
	isolation, using special purpose tools and languages such as XSLT. In
	order to use these special things, developers must become domain
	experts in a rich and complex space that is essentially unrelated to
	the application itself.</em>
