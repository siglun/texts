      <p>I cannot recall that I've ever written somewhere that I hate someone
      or even something.  I feel that hatred is emotional and irrational. It
      may be a difference between languages and cultures; it can be a question of semantic inflation. When we Scandinavians say that we hate something, we mean it.
      I'm not sure that that's the case in the anglo-american sphere.  However, it may also be a question of age; when you're middle-aged you may not think it's appropriate to hate, or you may not think that it's appropriate to describe your dislikes and annoyances as hatred.</p> <p>Already year 2000 a friend of mine described his relation to XML as <q>angle bracket fatique</q>, which is to be understood as <q>I hate typing XML</q></p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Chrisâ€™s big beef with XML is that XML must be processed in
	isolation, using special purpose tools and languages such as XSLT. In
	order to use these special things, developers must become domain
	experts in a rich and complex space that is essentially unrelated to
	the application itself.</em>
