      <p>Nick Nicholas, Nigel Ward and Kerry Blinco Abstract presents
      discusses at length in the article <a
      href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue62/nicholas-et-al/">Modelling of
      Digital Identifiers</a>.</p>

      <p>About eighty percent of the paper presents a taxonomy of possible
      identifiers. I hope that the authors enjoyed the intellectual exercise
      writing it.</p>

      <p>The remaining twenty percent disputes the current usage of URIs for
      identification, and in particular the use of HTTP URIs that can easily
      be dereferenced.</p>

      <p>I want to make one thing clear. What interests me is hypertext
      linking. In my world I am working with resources that are overlapping
      hierarchies of content objects, where the access point or anchor is to
      be decided by the user and not the service provider.</p>

      <p>Nicholas et al. are interested in something else. I cannot understand
      why they find these other things are useful. To me they are just
      boring.</p>
