      <p>If you're involved in what goes on on the Net at a technical level
      then you will at some stage run into acronyms asuch ISOC, IESG and
      IETF. They are, respectively, short for <a href="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/">Internet Engineering Steering Group</a>
      and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task
      Force</a>.</p>

      <p>Even if industry has contributed a lot to the development of Internet
      it has done so through these organizations. Furthermore, the Net as we
      know it with its standards, traditions and concepts comes from
      Academia. Internet grew out of a research project financed by the US
      Navy, which supported research at US universities such as University of
      California at Berkeley.</p>

      <p>These organizations keep track of their histories. Indeed the best
      Internet history comes from the IETF in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2235">Request For Comments
      2235</a>.</p>

      <h3>IANA</h3>

      <p>There is another important entity on the Internet. The <a href="http://www.iana.org">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a>
      (IANA). This organization has in its care the <em>Internet Root
      Zone</em>, that is it owns the name server that rules them all.</p>

      <p>IANA is also keeping track of <strong>the list</strong> of MIME <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">media types</a>. To
      explain the significance of this list, you have to think about all those
      times when you've failed to open some file sent to you with
      e-mail. That's what happens when the sender's message header contains an
      erroneous MIME media type.</p>

      <p>Laurent Romary and myself have spent quite some time this week
      writing an Internet draft.  The purpose of that draft is to add a single
      line on the list of media types, containing the string <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/teimime/">application/tei+xml</a>.</p>
