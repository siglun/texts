     <p>It has been a long and harsh winter here in Scandinavia. I am one of
     those who hate the cold darkness which characterizes my part of the
     world. Many of us have been thinking about the weather (Fig. 1).</p>

     <p>Since christmas I've been involved two projects, one of which is
     currently approaching deliverable. Unfortunately it has been delayed
     but on the other hand I've got the opportunity to learn Xforms.</p>

     <p>The other one is approaching.</p>



     <p>Those of us </p>
