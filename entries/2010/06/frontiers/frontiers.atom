      <p>Tablets, eReaders, Smartbooks: You Name the Device and It’s News at
      Computex <a href="http://blogs.arm.com/arm-events/tablets-ereaders-smartbooks-you-name-the-device-and-its-news-at-computex/">writes
      Katie Morgan</a>
      of Advanced Risc Machines (ARM). You may not know about it, but just as
      Intel rules the desktop, the British chip design company's ARM
      Architecture rules the pockets.</p>

      <p>According to Wikipedia, 90%+ of all processors in mobile phones and
      embedded devices are equipped with this architecture. This means that
      there's.a fair chance that both your phone, your wireless router and
      your fridge are all ARM systems.</p>

      <h3>The current chips</h3>

      <p>The mobiles &amp; the tablets are currently given prominent positions
      in the news feeds, and as I write this there one such item in top of
      Google News' Sci/Tech section. It is usually about Apple's iPhone or
      iPadd, both of which, by the way, like the Android systems, are ARM.</p>

      <p>Intel has tried to establish itself in this area, but have not been
      able to do so through can getting an increased market share by winning
      customers from ARM. The tablets is a new segment, and the race to start
      exploit the unchartered land. The chip Intel try to market here is the
      Atom processor which, of course, is x86. See, for instence:

	and Intel's new battleground: the living room</a>

      </p>

      <h3>Software frontiers</h3>

      <p>Google's Android &amp; Chromium are both Linux platforms (hence
      Helsinki &amp; Stanford Universities), whereas iPhone OS is a
      redecorated Berkeley Unix with a Mach kernel. Yes, it is a Mach kernel,
      as in the speed of sound, not Mac. This makes these gadgets University
      of California &amp; Carnegie Mellon University. Here is already at the
      basic level Europe against US, MIT, New England and Boston (GNU lives
      there) against California, Stanford against Berkeley.</p>

      <p>For those who don't know the history of the Unixes, it is well worth
      to know that Linux is a reverse engineered variant of the AT&amp;T
      System V Unix. Which isn't BSD Unix.</p>

      <p>At basic academic levels there's differences. Frontiers.</p>

      <p>Whenever theres conflicts, there are alliances, new ones and
      sometimes entirely unexpected:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>

	    <q>The good news is that we finally have an operating system to
	    unite behind. Android is an operating system that has gained a
	    tremendous amount of momentum all over the world</q>

	    [...]

	    <q>Android has become the fastest growing mobile operating system
	    in the world and, in fact, it has surpassed the iPhone in terms of
	    growth and in terms of users</q>,

	    said

	<li>
	  <p>
	    <q>Global leaders Intel Corporation and Nokia merge Moblin and
	    Maemo to create MeeGo, a Linux-based software platform that will
	    support multiple hardware architectures across the broadest range
	    of device segments, including pocketable mobile computers,
	    netbooks, tablets, mediaphones, connected TVs and in-vehicle
	    infotainment systems.</q> [...]

	    <q>MeeGo will be hosted by the Linux Foundation and governed using
	    the best practices of the open source development model.</q>

	    <p><a href="http://meego.org/meego-v1-0-core-software-platform-netbook-user-experience-project-release/">Just
	    recently Meego 1.0 was released</a>. A lot of creative work focus
	    on Meego, and it seem to gain impetus, there are aleady quite
	    discussions around it and even a positive review in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/05/hands-on-meego-for-netbooks-picks-up-where-moblin-left-off.ars">ArsTechnica</a>,
	    where you can find a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/06/meego-linux-platform-gains-allies-at-computex.ars">discussion
	    of the prospects of the system</a>.</p>

	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    This one is so interresting, so I just had to quote a whole list:
	    <ul>
	      <li>ARM, Freescale, IBM, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas
	      Instruments have created the not-for-profit company, Linaro,
	      committed to providing new resources and industry alignment for
	      open source software developers using Linux on the world’s most
	      sophisticated semiconductor System-on-Chips (SoCs).</li>

	      <li> Linaro will invest resources in open source projects that
	      can then be used by Linux-based distributions such as Android,
	      LiMo, MeeGo, Ubuntu and webOS.</li>

	      <li> Linaro will provide a stable and optimized base for
	      distributions and developers by creating new releases of
	      optimized tools, kernel and middleware software validated for a
	      wide range of SoCs, every six months.</li>

	      <li> Linaro's base of software and tools will be applicable to a
	      wide range of markets, helping reduce time-to-market for
	      products such as smart phones, tablets, digital televisions,
	      automotive entertainment and enterprise equipment.</li>

	      <li> Linaro's first software and tools release is due out in
	      November 2010, and will provide optimizations for the latest
	      range of ARM® Cortex™-A family of processors.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.linaro.org/arm-freescale-ibm-samsung-st-ericsson-and-texas-instruments-form-new-company-to-speed-the-rollout-of-linux-based-devices/">linaro.org</a>. It seems that,
	  Linaro's mission is to ensure that there will be a Linux kernels and
	  device drivers for a large number of mobile platforms.</p>

	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Anyone percieving a pattern? There are quite a few companies out
      there that see an opportonity for both innovation and business. Quite a
      few of them would very much like to see a future without Apple and
      Microsoft and furthermote, there are some that wouldn't mind a bit less
      influence of Intel and AMD.</p>

      <h3>The PC and the Tablet</h3>

      <p>I read and write mail, manage my calendars, surf and do a better part
      of my wordprocessing with my <a href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/05/n900/">tablet</a>. I
      also do word processing on it. I want a hand-held gadget which enabling
      me to be creative anywhere anytime. This is one of many the preliminary
      answers to the questions the industry is posing to the market.</p>

      <p>The vendors have obviously radically different views on the future of
      computing. Recently Steve Jobs claimed that the PC as we know it is like
      an old truck and that the future belongs to the tablets. Steve Ballmer
      participated in the same conference and disputed these claims. He seemed
      to be convinced that the desktop PC will.continue to be the workstation
      for a foreseeable future.</p>

      <p><q>The PC as we know it will continue to morph,</q> he said. <q>The
      real question is what are you going to push.</q> In Microsoft’s case,
      the answer is more machines that run flavors of Windows. <q>To a man with
      a hammer everything looks like a nail; we have a hammer,</q> Mr. Ballmer
      joked.</p>
