  <summary>I've bought a new camera. And I'm now a very enthusiastic owner of
  one of the new EVIL cameras, an Olympus E-P2.</summary>

      <p>I have just recently bought a new digital camera, one of the new <a

      E-P 2, which is a second generation <a

      Thirds</a> camera. One could say that I've ditched my SLR, but that I

	  capable of flash synchronization. That is the <em>only</em>
	  electronics it has.

      <h3>How I ditched my SLR</h3>

      <p>I've been interested in photography since I was a teenager. My father
      was a printer and he had a workshop where I worked during summer
      holidays. When I was thirteen or fourteen I used my savings together
      with some extra support from my parents to by a Nikon F single-lens
      reflex camera. This must have been 1969-70. I still keep this treasure,
      but the configuration has improved. The original 50 mm F1.4 lens was
      replaced with a 35mm wide angle and a 135m tele lens. My Nikon stuff are
      items number 4-10 in Figure 1.</p>

      <p>During the mid eighties I lost my interest in photography, but it was
      (kind of) revitalized when our two children were born 1988-89. That lead
      to the acquisition of an easy to use 35mm compact camera, which could be
      carried a pocket and swiftly pulled out to document the various
      milestones in the kids development.</p>

      <p>More recently my wife and myself decided, I'd say less than five
      years ago, that the time was ripe to buy a digital camera. A bit later
      still we acquired smarter phones. The digital camera was actually a
      really good one. I used it to take the snap shot in Figure 1. The phone
      caused a new development I hadn't expected.</p>
