  <title>A tale of two lenses</title>
  <link href="/entries/2010/12/twolenses/"/>
  <summary>Here I discuss two lenses. Both are very new. I've owned them less
  than three months, and they represent recent developments from the
  respective companies building them. But appart from that they differ in
  almost all aspects. Even in the very idea behind their existence.</summary>

      <p>Here I discuss two lenses. Both are very new. I've owned them less
      than three months, and they represent recent developments from the
      respective companies building them. But appart from that they differ in
      almost all aspects. Even in the very idea behind their existence.</p>

      <h3>Superwide Heliar 15mm F4.5</h3>

      <p>Heliar is produced by Cosina Voigtländer. There is no company having
      that name, though. Cosina is a Japanese company building cameras and
      camera lenses. Voigtländer is one of the very old brands in German
      optical industries. It is Johann Christoph Voigtländer founded the
      company 1756 long before Louis Daguerre invented the photographic
      process.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Cosina">Cosina</a>, on the
      other hand, was founded 1959 during the Japanese industrial expansion
      after the second world war. The company have made very little for sale
      under its own brand but much more producing lenses and bodies for sale
      under brands like Nikon, Contax, Zeiss and now most recently
      Voigtländer. While Cosina builds, for instance, Zeiss Ikon cameras
      designed by the German Company, Cosina has leased and controls
      Voigtländer brand. The products sold as Voigtländer are interesting,
      such as lenses bodies for the Nikon S, Contax and Leica M systems. You
      can actually get a modern lens produced for a camera system that Nikon
      discontinued 1965.</p>

      <p>I can very much symphasize with those ideas. Cosina is designing and
      marketing new stuff in a more of 50 years tradition. And a lot of people
      wants their products, but, yes, the products addresses various niche
      markets.</p>

      <p>The Superwide Heliar is a Leica M mount lens. I bought it because I
      wanted a classical wideangle lens. One that allows me to set focus at 3
      meter, and aperture 8 and then be able to expect that just about
      everything from <a
      href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36853098@N06/5108217890">one meter to
      infinity is within focus</a>.  It works. Heliar is exectly that kind of
      lens. Excellent for <a
      href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/5024127214/">candid
      street photography</a> where you are not able to focus at all. Such a
      lens is wonderful for capturing a lot at the same time, such as <a
      href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/5126351059">a lot of
      water</a> or a lot of <a
      href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/5068063027/">just
      about anything, such as trees</a>. The wideangle lens captures it
      all. For some reason, there always seem to be even more of the stuff on
      your photo. More water or more trees.</p>

      <h3>M.Zuiko Digital 14-42mm F3.5-5.6</h3>

      <p>I cannot mount the Superwide Heliar on my Micro Four Thirds (MFT)
      camera without an adaptor. The M.Zuiko came with the camera. It was
      designed to be the kit lens, and I suppose that such a thing has to be
      good and inexpensive at the same time. It is part of the initial sales
      arguments.
