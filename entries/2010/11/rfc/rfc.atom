      href="http://sigfrid-lundberg.se/entries/2010/03/appteixml/">Earlier
      this year</a> Laurent Romary and myself authored an Internet Draft,
      which the first step to an Request For Comments (RFC). Now this text has
      been trough the review process and we have made all the revisions
      required. Finally it has now been approved by the <a
      href="http://www.iesg.org">IESG</a>'s review process. I now understand
      the RFC concept.</p>

      <p>Internet was created by people connected to the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darpanet">DARPA net</a> with the
      first serious experimental work starting around 1968. The people who did
      it were affiliated to various US universities and a few companies
      capable mean, you send your idea on how Internet can be made better to
      your fellow researches in ARPA net.</p>

      <p>It seems that these people communicated their findings by storing and
      circulating as odd text files on the very infrastructures that were the
      subjects for their research. And now more than forty years later there
      still is this mix of individuals from academic and corporate research
      environments from all over the world. Friendly geeks who want that the
      Internet should be good place. So, when you submit a draft you
      <em>do</em> get comments, a lot of them but all were constructive and
      friendly.</p>
