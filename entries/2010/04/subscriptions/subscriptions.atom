  <title>A Safari among Subscription Libraries</title>
  <link href="/entries/2010/04/subscriptions/"/>
  <summary>I have been a subscriber to O'Reilly's Safari services for quite
  some years now. Recently I upgraded the subscription such that I get access
  to the entire stock without limitations.</summary>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/">London Library</a> is
      an <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_library">independent
      subscription library</a>. In the UK there are quite a few libraries of
      this kind left, in spite of the fact that it is more or less an
      anachronism. There are enough of them to organize themselves in an <a
      href="http://www.independentlibraries.co.uk/">Association of Independent
      Libraries</a>. The London Library is the largest member of the
      organization, and it is also the one with the highest membership fee.</p>

      <p>O'Reilly, the book publishling company, has an <a
      href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">online subscription library</a>,
      perhaps mainly aimed at technical people like myself. I've had a
      personal subscription for quite some time, and I recently I upgraded the
      subscription such that I have unlimited access to the entire stock. The
      fee is $53.74 (including VAT 25%). That's $656.88 per annum which is
      £398.60. This is an interesting figure, since the annual membership fee
      for The London Library is £395.00.</p>
