      <p>Nicholas Carr, 2008. Is Google Making Us Stupid?  What the Internet
      is doing to our brains. <em>The Atlantic Magazine</em>.  <a
      href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/</a></p>

      <blockquote
      cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/"><em>Over
      the past few years I’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or
      something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural
      circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn’t going—so far as I can
      tell—but it’s changing.</em></blockquote>

      <p>writes Nicholas Carr, and continues a bit further down:</p>

      <blockquote
      cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/"><em>Immersing
      myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My mind would get
      caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument, and I’d spend
      hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That’s rarely the case
      anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three
      pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else
      to do. I feel as if I’m always dragging my wayward brain back to the
      text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a
      struggle.</em></blockquote>

      <p>I first read this article in a printed Swedish translation about a
      year and a half ago in the <a href="http://www.axess.se/magasin/">Axess
      Magasin</a>. Then months later I found the original and started to
      reread it. However, initially I read it without realizing that I had
      read it already. I had to read it twice in English before I could
      establish the connection between the two versions. It was when I started
      to follow the arguments that I recognized the article. I add this,
      because it accentuates Carr's arguments.</p>

      <p>The texts on the Internet are generally brief. I don't say Fyodor
      Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky's texts somehow become more condensed in
      digital editions, but an entry like this one is shorter than articles in
      newspapers and magazines. We are accustomizing ourselves to brevity and
      and have difficulties reading longer texts. This is just a symptom;
      Nicholas Carr reviews some evidence and I'm convinced that our media
      consumption habits are changing, and he even convinces me that this
      affects the brain itself.</p>

      <p>Does it matter. Nicholas Carr does not even try to answer that
      question. It might be that the Internet brain has acclimatized itself to
      the new information environment, and that is neither good or bad. He
      also discusses <q><em>Plato’s Phaedrus,</em> [in which] <em>Socrates
      bemoaned the development of writing. He feared that, as people came to
      rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to
      carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the
      dialogue’s characters, 'cease to exercise their memory and become
      forgetful.'</em></q></p>

      <p>Then, through history, this bemoaning has been repeated at each step
      when media production and consumption passes through a new period of
      rapid development.</p>

      <p>Socrates was most likely correct: People's memory deteriorated when
      they no longer had to memorize Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and
      <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
