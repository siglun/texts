      <p>He sat on his knees and started to penetrate the tiles with hammer
      and chisel. I pulled my camera and just before I pressed the shutter, he
      stretched his back.</p>
      <p> He noticed me taking the photograph.<br/>
      <q>It is hard!</q> he said.<br/>
      <q>What kind of stone is it?</q> I asked.<br/>
      <q>Granite</q> said he.<br/>
      Then he bent down and continued to penetrate the stone.</p>

      <p>Today I decided to return and have a look.  New nice
      tiles. Slightly more gray. Don't know what he was up to.</p>

      <p>None of my business, anyway.</p>
