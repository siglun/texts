      <p>I've written some portraits of the lenses I've been using most. One
      of them is the <a href="../../../2012/07/heliar/">Super wide Heliar 15mm
      f/4.5</a>. As a matter of fact I don't use it as much as before. Mainly
      because it has become much more wide angle than it used to be. On a full
      frame sensor it becomes <em>super wide</em>. Never before I've been able
      to capture the whole cathedral, and more.</p>

      <p>Some of its deficiencies become more obvious, as well. Not that they
      are that important when stopping down a few steps, and some people are
      applying special post-processing tools to get that the vignetting in the
      corner.</p>

      <p>Anyway, that lens which used to be mounted continuously three years
      ago is now living a calm life on a shelf.</p>
