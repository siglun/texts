  <title>On focusing on the essentials</title>
  <link href="/entries/2011/05/focus/"/>
  <summary>I acquired a socalled mirrorless interchangable lens camera in
  August last year. Since than I have used it exclusively with manual focus
  vintage lenses. Here I discuss my experience blending old and new imaging
  technologies.</summary>

      <p>Photography is visual storyteling, among other things. The stories I
      want to tell isn't about photographic equipment but about us human
      beings, our environments, emotions and about our time inasmuch as one
      can learn anything about that from what I see in my own life.</p>

      <p>However, it is the equipment that give me the means for telling those
      stories. A camera consists of a lens and a body. Just a few months after
      I had acquired my new digital system camera I decided to use manual
      prime lenses (Figure 1). There are issues with using manual lenses. One
      of them is that you have to focus. Manually. Thom Hogan puts it like
      this</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>My personal take is that manual focus really only works well in
	two situations: where you have a stationary subject and time; and when
	you use depth of field and a preset focus distance (ala Henri
	Cartier-Bresson's shooting style).</em>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I have no problems with Henri Cartier-Bresson's shooting style. I use
      that all the time. I mount my 15mm Heliar using a Leica M adaptor and I
      at aperture 8 I have a depth of field from less than a meter to
      infinity (Figure 2).</p>

      <p>The Flickr group <em>Decisive Moment</em> devoted to photography in
      Cartier-Bresson's style. The guidelines states, among other things
      that</p>

	  <small>Figure 3. My Nikkor-O Auto 35mm f/2.0 and the 40mm M-Rokkor coexists
	  because they occupy slightly different ecological niches. Nikkor-O
	  has a closest range at about 30cm is it is an almost macro
	  lens. At aperture 2 and 2.8 it has a very nice bokeh.</small>

	<em>There should be a Background that contributes to the overall
	composition. In most cases this Background is in focus.</em> <a

      <p>So, what was enforced by necessity, the level of technological
      development between 1930-1960 has become an artitistic characteristic of
      a genre. However, the Henri Cartier-Bresson shooting style is more or
      less implemented in hardware in all point and shoot compact
      cameras. Mobile cameras have a very large depth of field, since the very
      small sensor gives you a standard lens with a small focal length.</p>

      <p>I have a need for being able to take photos of small
      things. Obviously a macro lens would have been ideal, but I have not yet
      been able to acquire one of those. However, my two Nikon F mount lenses
      are both <q>almost macro</q>. The 35mm lens allows me to focus on
      objects as close as about 25cm (Figure 3).</p>

      <p>To focus swiftly on a moving insect or something as close as 25cm is
      difficult. I haven't tried very much. I guess that capturing a bee or
      butterfly approaching a flower is extremely difficult, and that a preset
      focus distance won't help very much. If you have stage where you expect
      your subject will appear, then you can focus on something on it and
      press the shutter in the decisive moment.</p>

      <p>With my 40mm (Figure 4) and 105mm lenses (Figure 5) I have to focus
      and do so accurately.</p>
