      <p>Photography is visual storyteling, among other things. The stories I
      want to tell isn't about photographic equipment but about us human
      beings, our environments, emotions and about our time inasmuch as one
      can learn anything about that from what I see in my own life.</p>

      <p>Equipment should really be unimportant. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haas">Ernst Haas</a> is
      reported to have made the following remark on the question which camera
      brand is best: <q><em>All of them can record what you are seeing.  But,
      you have to SEE.</em></q> (Quoted from Ken Rockwell's <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm"><em>Your Camera
      Doesn't Matter</em></a>. He claims that the anecdote comes from Murad
      Saÿen. Anyway, Rockwell's essay on photographic quality is brilliant.)</p>

      <p>However, it is the equipment that give me the means for telling those
      stories. A camera consists of a lens and a body. Today a body is
      obsolete in two or three years time and their longevity is decreasing
      and will approach that of a mobile phone. The lens is a serious matter
      for me, and I cannot stand the idea to acquire new lenses just because
      I've bought a new body.</p>

      <p>About a month after I had bought my new digital system camera I
      decided that I wanted to use my old Nikon lenses, and that I wanted to
      get a small but useful collection of manual prime lenses (Figure 1).</p>

      <p>There are issues with using manual lenses. One of them is that you
      have to focus. Manually. This entry is about focusing. I illustrate it
      with examples from my own photography, which may not be perfectly sharp.</p>

      <p>Thom Hogan has written about using manual lenses on micro four third
      bodies. His conclusions are:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>My personal take is that manual focus really only works well in
	two situations: where you have a stationary subject and time; and when
	you use depth of field and a preset focus distance (ala Henri
	Cartier-Bresson's shooting style).</em>

      </blockquote>

      <p>I have no problems with Henri Cartier-Bresson's shooting style. I use
      that all the time. I mount my 15mm Heliar using a Leica M adaptor and
      at aperture 8 I have a depth of field from less than a meter to
      infinity (Figure 2).</p>

      <p>The Flickr group <em>Decisive Moment</em> devoted to street
      photography in Cartier-Bresson's style. The guidelines states, among
      other things that</p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>There should be a Background that contributes to the overall
	composition. In most cases this Background is in focus.</em> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/decisivemoment/">Decisive

	  because they occupy slightly different ecological niches. Nikkor-O
	  has a closest range at about 30cm is it is an almost macro
	  lens. At aperture 2 and 2.8 it has a very nice bokeh.</small>

      <p>So, what was enforced by necessity, the level of technological
      development between 1930-1960 has become an artitistic characteristic of
      a genre. However, the Henri Cartier-Bresson shooting style is more or
      less implemented in hardware in all point and shoot compact
      cameras. Mobile cameras have a very large depth of field, since the very
      small sensor gives you a standard lens with a small focal length.</p>

      <p>I have a need for being able to take photos of small
      things. Obviously a macro lens would have been ideal, but I have not yet
      been able to acquire one of those. However, my two Nikon F mount lenses
      are both <q>almost macro</q>. The 35mm lens allows me to focus on
      objects as close as about 25cm (Figure 3).</p>

      </div>


      <p>To focus swiftly on a moving insect or something as close as 25cm
      with a paperthin DOF is difficult. I have tried it, but not very much. A
      preset focus distance won't help very much.</p>

      <p>On the street you can choose a stage where you expect a subject may
      appear. You can focus on something on adjust the DOF and wait. Press the
      shutter in the decisive moment. This is preset focus, mentioned by
      Hogan.</p>

      <p>With my 35mm (Figure 3), 40mm (Figure 4 &amp; 5) and 105mm lenses
      (Figure 6) I have to focus and do so accurately. The four people on
      Figure 4 is a very good example on a shot with preset focus. I focused
      on the door behind the people when I saw them approaching, and got two
      shots while they passed each other.</p>

      <p>Then we have the knob on my roller blinds (Figure 5). The knob is
      sharp. You can find it in the lower right corner of the image. The dirt
      on the window is in focus as well. I took photo just because I wanted to
      demonstrate how you can control the focusing of a manual lens. I've
      tried in vain to repeat that with an auto-focus lens.</p>

      <p>There are three issues for me here. (i) The feeling of the lens when
      you use it, (ii) You're ability to control the depth of field and (iii)
      the attitude that photographic equipment is some kind of electronic
      consumer equipment stuff, rather than means for artistic creation.</p>

      <p>Manual focus lenses permit me to focus on the essentials. What I can
      see. Not on what the camera designers think I would like to focus on. When
      I fail, I cannot blame it on anyone else.</p>
