      <p>I met Gustav Holmberg, a history of science scholar who also has a
      deep interest in photography, at the butcher's shop. He was gazing
      intently at my camera, well perhaps not the camera, but at my CV
      Super-Wide Heliaf 15mm/4.5. This lens is obviously one of those that he
      would be interested to fit on his Leica M3. Now he has started his own
      series with camera portraits like the one in <a
      href="http://tokyocamerastyle.com/">Tokyo Camera Style</a>. See his <a
      href="http://www.5063.com/fotografiskt/tag/lund-camera-style/">Lund
      Camera Style (in Swedish)</a>.</p>
