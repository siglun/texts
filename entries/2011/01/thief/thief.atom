      <p>Around 2003 I began the political foot work to establish the <a
      href="http://www.ediffah.org/">Ediffah project</a>, which was meant to
      establish an union catalog for archival collections at the larger
      Swedish research libraries. As usual when you're up to something like
      that you have to talk to and visit the right people.</p>

      <p>One of the right people, in this case, was the Head of Manuscript and
      Rare books collections at the <a
      href="http://www.kb.se/english/">National Library of Sweden</a>. Let's
      call him John, since that is what he is called in the TV series coming
      up on Swedish National Television tonight.</p>
