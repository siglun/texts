      <p>When a subject contains vidid colours, I invariably transform the
      photo to black and white. If there are few I usually preserve
      colour. Unless there is special conditions that make me feel that colour
      is important. For instance, when the image contain vivid colours.</p>

      There is a story connected to this photo, related to how I shoot and the
      workings of my camera. It stores one raw file and one JPG. The camera is
      always set on ISO 400, B&amp;W and the focus ring turned to infinity and
      the aperture to 5.6 so that when i switch it on everything should be
      predictable. When I saw the dog and this child start climbing the stair
      I pulled the camera and started to shoot. I never realized that she were
      all clad in red until I did the processing.

      I see things in actions, juxtapositions, geometries, depth of field and
      point of view, surfaces and texture, reflections and shadows,
      basically. Colours don't enter my photography, somehow. They are just
      complicated.
