      <p>There is a story connected to this photo, shown here in both colour
      and black and white. I visited the opening of a new exhibition at <a href="http://martinbrydergallery.se/">Martin Bryder Gallery</a>. While
      having a good time, I saw the dog and that this child started to climb
      the stair. I pulled the camera and shot this image. The whole process is
      more or less automatic. I didn't even realize that she were all clad in
      red until I did the processing.</p>
      
      <p>The story is both related to how I shoot and the workings of my camera.</p>

      <p>I have some standard settings, actually one per lens I use
      regularly. The Ricoh GXR allows me to store them as named
      configurations. So when I switch on my camera, it set on ISO 400. For
      every shot it stores a raw file (in colour) and one JPG in B&amp;W. The
      camera is set on aperture preset (A). The focus ring should be turned to
      infinity and the aperture set on 5.6.</p>

      <p>When I switch on the camera, everything is predictable.</p>

      <p>The things I see and think of are related to timing, such as actions
      and juxtapositions and composition. That is geometry, pull-in lines, 
      point of view and perspective. Then there are surfaces and texture,
      reflections and shadows and depth of field. These are the basics of
      photography, still difficult to master.</p>
      
      <p>Note that colours just don't enter my photography. I don't see them
      in my viewfinder, nor in live view. I saw the dog and the girl
      before pulling the camera, still I don't remember that she was a young
      lady in red.</p>

      <p>Colours are just too complicated.</p> 

      <p>I don't understand them. And I have no time to think about them while
      shooting.</p>

      <p>By the way. Of the few comments I got on this one on Flickr, all of
      those who mentioned the colour problem found that the B&amp;W was the
      one they like the most.</p>

      <h2>Landscapes</h2>

      <div style="width:60%;float:left;margin:0.5em;">

      </div>

      <p>In landscape photography you have plenty of time. I do often shoot
      landscape in colour. In particular when it is fog, rain or snow. I.e.,
      good photo weather.</p>

      <div style="width:60%;float:right;margin:0.5em;">      
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/6907242632/" title="R0013060.JPG by Sigfrid Lundberg, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/6907242632_43583b8224.jpg" width="100%" alt="R0013060.JPG"/></a>
      </div>

      <p>But snow is often increasing the contrast, and that can accentuated
      by making black &amp; white. As in this example.</p>

      <h2>Flowers</h2>

      <div style="width:40%;float:left;margin:0.5em;">
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sigfridlundberg/7187484844/" title="R0013720.tif by Sigfrid Lundberg, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7103/7187484844_0636b0f241.jpg" width="100%" alt="R0013720.tif"/></a>
      </div>

      <p>The comments in Flickr about these two versions of the same flower
      shots two said that they liked the black and white better than the
      colour one.</p>

      <h2>A general rule</h2>

      <p>When a subject contains vidid colours, I invariably transform the
      photo to black and white. If there are few I usually preserve
      colour. Unless there is special conditions that make me feel that the
      colours are important. For instance, when the subject contains vivid
      colours.</p>
