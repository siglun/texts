      <p>Since November last year I've been shooting M mount (See Figure
      1). There is, however, no <strong>real</strong> Leica stuff. I could
      possibly afford the real thing but then I would have to sacrifice a lot
      from the other parts in my life to get a marginal improvement of my kit.</p>

      <p>
	The Leica brand is so strong that many buy cameras that are look alike
	or work alies. I too suffers from Leica envy inasmuch, but limit
	myself to admiring the lenses. I'm no longer interested in rangefinder
	technology. Among other things because I still have some really nice
	old Nikon lenses.
      </p>

      <p>
	Instead the I have acquired the Ricoh GXR Mount A12, also known as
	GXR-M. That camera has some advantages. It is M mount, i.e., I can use
	lenses for the Leica mount without adapter. Then, it is optimized for
	use together with manual lenses. For instance, Ashwin Rao <a
	href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2011/09/28/the-ricoh-gxr-a12-m-mount-module-review-by-ashwin-rao/">describes
	how he is able to do manual focus</a> fast enough for sports
	photography. That impressed me, and it was one of the factors that
	settled the issue for me. Indeed, the focus peaking methods have
	become even more important for me since my eye sight has deteriorated
	since I ordered it.

      <p>
	Then, it has really good image quality.  <a
	href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/ricoh_lens_mount_a12.shtml"
	rel="nofollow">Sean Reid</a> was the one who convinced me that
	anti-aliasing filters are detrimental for image quality.

      <p>
	Finally, the user interface is very well thought out. See <a
	href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/ricoh_gxr_a12_field_report.shtml"
	>Luminous Landscape's The field report</a>.

      <p>I've presented most of my the lenses here and on Flickr before. On
      Figure 1 you can see Heliar 15mm f/4.5, 25mm f/2.8 ZM-Biogon and
      M-Rokkor 40mm f/2 which is mounted on the GXR-M body. On Figure 2 you
      see the body and a F mount and one M mount lens. Also, the the Nikon F
      to Leica M adapter is there.</p>
