      This note discusses different initiatives as regards providing access to
      resources and tools aimed at researchers within the humanities. Since
      the general breakthrough of search services like Google, annotation and
      bookmarking services like del.icio.us and the like, the attitudes
      towards the application of computing within the humanities has
      changed. In addition, the concept of e-science has contributed to make
      scholars positive to apply computing to various problems within the
      humanities.  Following a discussion started around year 2000, we propose
      that it is possible to formalize many humanities computing tasks as
      pipelines between XML processing steps.
