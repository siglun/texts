  site. This entry is about the problems of syndication and how you are
  limited by the styling and layout on the site where your material is
  presented.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>, <a href="/2010">2010</a></p><p>2010-03-17: <a href="/entries/2010/03/pilin/"><em>Modelling identifers?</em></a><br/>Nick Nicholas, Nigel Ward and Kerry Blinco helps obscuring the

  persistence strategy. We also conclude that the hypertext link is the single
  thing that makes the Worldwide web to a web. Hence it is a serious thing. If
  you're working within the digital library world you should be devoted to the
  hypertext link.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  belong to the strategic field, and in that field the only thing I can offer
  is advice.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  interface</em></a><br/>I've had a javascript based forum with thread for each entry. That
  seemed boring to me. Why should users be restricted to commenting entire
  articles. Why not letting them add footnotes to arbitrary positions in a
  text. In this entry I experiment with this feature.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  put the library on the web, or is it basically to the library's resources
  visible to users anywhere on the globe?<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>, <a href="/2009">2009</a></p><p>2009-08-21: <a href="/entries/2009/08/quotations/"><em>A quotation is much more than an extract</em></a><br/>In my last entry, on cool URIs, I discussed the identification of
  documents. The conclusion from that is that people in the library world are
  obsessed by being able to find documents. I take that more serious than most
  other library folk. I'd say that it is our mission to help our patrons find
  a single word in a text, a rectangle in an image and so forth. The time is
  gone when we could tell users: The answer to your question might be in any
  of the books on that shelf.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>, <a href="/2009">2009</a></p><p>2009-08-15: <a href="/entries/2009/08/cooluris/"><em>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned... I have moved a
  document</em></a><br/>The initiatives behind the persistent linking is trying to change
  the status of old documents. From 404 to 200. We've had some success with
  books and journals using ISBN and ISSN numbers. Why not try to copy this to
  the web? But, alas!, library people have in general too little understanding
  of the Worldwide Web. In particular those who advocate persistent
  identifiers.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>, <a href="/2009">2009</a></p><p>2009-07-21: <a href="/entries/2009/07/structure/"><em>The description and encoding of structure</em></a><br/>Much metadata is fairly stright forward. A book does have a title
  and an author. That's usually no big deal. We've been able to handle that
  for centuries. A digital book has chapters, and everything you might want to
  know may be in chapter two on page seventyfive. Or someone may tell you the
  solution to your problems after a quarter of an hour in some video on
  YouTube. Now, how do we cope with this?<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  on standards. But why are the search engines lagging behind? Browsers are
  capable of AJAX and advanced XML processing, but the search engines are
  still basically just removing tags and presenting raw text extracts.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>, <a href="/2009">2009</a></p><p>2009-07-06: <a href="/entries/2009/07/colophon/"><em>About this site</em></a><br/>I'm a terrible nerd. To use software like content management
  systems or blog software is unthinkable for me. There are many ways to build
  a site like this. I have chosen one that maximizes the use of angle
  brackets.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  encoded some documents, and written the software to parse and use it for
  something useful. This somewhat refurbished version of my web site is to a
  large extent built upon the ATOM syndication format, and here I discuss my
  experience.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

    page?</em></a><br/>What can deduced by analyses of the search terms entered into the
    search field on the home page of a large modern library? Could we possibly
    regard this form as the digital libraryÂ´s information desk, and the
    queries as the request from its patrons? If we do that, what could we then
    learn about the quality of service?  In this note we do just that. We
    regard the terms entered into the form as manifestation of our patrons
    needs and in order to find out what they need, we have performed a
    preliminary text mining exercise. We hope that this will help us designing
    a new search facility that will better answer the needs of our
    users.<br/><a href="/subjects/webindexing/">Web indexing</a>,
