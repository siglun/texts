  encoded some documents, and written the software to parse and use it for
  something useful. This somewhat refurbished version of my web site is to a
  large extent built upon the ATOM syndication format, and here I discuss my
  experience.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  on standards. But why are the search engines lagging behind? Browsers are
  capable of AJAX and advanced XML processing, but the search engines are
  still basically just removing tags and presenting raw text extracts.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a></p><p><strong><a href="/2009">2009</a>: </strong><a href="/entries/2009/07/colophon/"><em>About this site</em></a><br/>I'm a terrible nerd. To use software like content management
  systems or blog software is unthinkable for me. There are many ways to build
  a site like this. I have chosen one that maximizes the use of angle
  brackets.<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

  and an author. That's usually no big deal. We've been able to handle that
  for centuries. A digital book has chapters, and everything you might want to
  know may be in chapter two on page seventyfive. Or someone may tell you the
  solution to your problems after a quarter of an hour in some video on
  YouTube. Now, how do we cope with this?<br/><a href="/subjects/structuralwebdesign/">Structural web design</a>,

    the material was hidden away in the the library opac or published on our
    web site. The result was as expected a disappointment for those who regard
    the Library catalogue as an important vehicle for dissemination of digital

    search field on the home page of a large modern library? Could we possibly
    regard this form as the digital libraryÂ´s information desk, and the
    queries as the request from its patrons? If we do that, what could we then
    learn about the quality of service?  In this note we do just that. We
    regard the terms entered into the form as manifestation of our patrons
    needs and in order to find out what they need, we have performed a
    preliminary text mining exercise. We hope that this will help us designing
    a new search facility that will better answer the needs of our
    users.<br/><a href="/subjects/webindexing/">Web indexing</a>,
