      <h2>The problem</h2>

      <p>The common wisdom among library staff is that "everything
      should be in the OPAC". This view does have virtues: If users
      know for sure that every resource provided by a library could be
      accessed through one single point of access, then that is indeed
      a good thing. However, real world is not that simple. World-wide
      web search engines have the last ten or twelve years become
      increasingly important access points for digital resources.</p>

      <p>Users of web based resources expect to find what they need
      through search engines. To be accessible that way, material need
      a browsable user interface in order to be indexed. The browsable
      interface is also important for the users; hypertext links to
      other parts of the information providers web site is essential
      for the users ability to assess the quality of the retrieved
      information object.</p>

      <p>A significant portion of our digitization effort is put into
      production of digital images. They have usually been stored on
      the server img.kb.dk. Some of these images are bundled into
      documents through different means, e.g., by producing multi-page
      PDFs. Some of these documents are made accessible by cataloging
      them in our OPAC, rex.kb.dk, and some through databases on
      base.kb.dk or resource pages on our web site, www.kb.dk. We may
      see this as prototypes for two strategies of publishing. The
      former (cataloging in the OPAC) is characterized by that it is a
      <em>searchable only</em> resource the latter is a
      <em>navigable</em> one, since most services on the our web
      (base.kb.dk and www.kb.dk) does have a browsable in addition to
      a search box. To formulate it in another way: The OPAC belongs
      to what one a few years ago labeled as the hidden web.</p>

      <p>In this note I have made an attempt to compare the efficiency
      of the two strategies by analysis of web access log statistics,
      to determine which of the strategies provides the most effective
      access to these resources.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="lvl2">

      <h2>On the data</h2>

      <p>Most modern browsers returns information on what is called
      <em>referring page</em>. This is the URL of the page on which
      the browser found the retrieved link. Referring page data makes
      it possible to analyse linkage patterns and the ways users find
      their way to digital resources. For digital images, the
      referring page is the page in which the image is embedded, for
      things like HTML pages or PDFs it is the page which links to the
      object.</p>

      <p>My analysis was done as follows: I gathered all access log info for
      the months January to October 2007 on the host img.kb.dk. I removed all
      accesses that could be attributed to harvesting or archiving robots by
      creating a list of accessing hosts that had retrieved the robots.txt
      file. Accesses from these hosts were then discarded. Then I created a
      table with two columns, the file names of the retrieved resources and
      the domain of server that hosted the page that linked to or embedded the
      objects. The number of hits could then easily be counted with using
      different selection or filtering criteria.</p>

      <p>The data set contains close to 3 million hits (2843368) from
      users that found their way to our digital objects through
      linking or embedding from 1426 unique hosts world-wide. Not
      surprisingly a majority, about two thirds, of the hits came from
      links on our own sites (1889247 hits).</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="lvl2">

      <h2>Analysis</h2>

      <p>For answering the question I posed above, I chose to analyse
      digitized sheet music. A search on WWW=http* (i.e., searching
      for URLs with URL scheme http) in the Digital Music database
      within the KB catalogue <a
      href="http://rex.kb.dk/">http://rex.kb.dk/</a> shows that
      catalogue provides access to 3249 digital objects. I have been
      unable to produce a corresponding figure for what is made
      available through the web sites base.kb.dk and www.kb.dk.</p>

      <p>The total number of PDF files in the music department's
      img.kb.dk web area is 4530. This figure is a grand total
      including the same objects in different resolutions, and
      there might also be objects yet to be published.</p>

      <p>Of these files, only 2898 were requested at all with
      referring pages from the kb.dk domain. 2226 files were
      requested from the web sites only, 950 files from the catalogue
      only (out of 3249 possible). Why this is the case, I do not yet
      know for sure. However, on the page <a
      href="http://www.kb.dk/elib/noder/"> Danmarks Digitale
      Nodebibliotek</a> there are links to "Gieddes Samling af
      fløjtemusik" and "Rischel &amp; Birket-Smiths Samling af
      guitarmusik" in a prominent position. Most of the hits from the
      OPAC are for objects in these two collections. The explanatory
      links into the OPAC are indeed helpful; users can easier search
      (successfully formulate a query) if they know what to
      expect.</p>

      <p>There is small overlap, 278 files are referred to from
      both the web and the catalogue. I will return to them below.</p>

      <p>Assuming that all the 2226+278=2504 objects that were
      retrieved through links from base.kb.dk and www.kb.dk is the
      total number of files published via the web we may estimate that
      about 40% of the sheet music published by the Royal Library
      through the <em>navigable</em> and about 60% through the
      <em>search only</em>. Our digital Sheet music is thus very
      suitable for testing the efficiency of the search only
      publishing strategy.</p>

      <p>To obtain the data I looked on objects carrying sheet music
      based on directory name, limiting the analysis to the mime type
      PDF. I only take into account referring pages within the kb.dk
      domain. The data is summarized in Table 1.</p>

      <table border="1">
	<caption>Table 1. Retrieval of sheet music computer files with
	referring pages on important KB servers.</caption>
	<tr>
	  <th>Host of referring page</th><th>Number of hits</th><th>Proportion</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>base.kb.dk</td><td>36197</td><td>57.6%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>www.kb.dk</td><td>15068</td><td>24.0%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>rex.kb.dk</td><td>11603</td><td>18.5%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>total</td><td>62868</td><td>100%</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>What we can see is that links from base.kb.dk and www.kb.dk
      together attracted 51265 users and the links on rex.kb.dk only
      11603, which amounts to 81% of the hits emanating from the web
      sites.</p>

      <p>To be even more specific, we can extract the individual files
      that have been requested from both the OPAC and the web. We have
      found 278 objects on img.kb.dk that are linked to from both the
      OPAC (rex.kb.dk) and the web (base.kb.dk or www.kb.dk). If we
      recalculate the table above for this subset only we get:</p>

      <table border="1">
	<caption>Table 2. Retrieval of a subset of sheet music
	computer files which are catalogued on multiple services both
	on the web and in the OPAC.</caption>
	<tr>
	  <th>Host of referring page</th><th>Number of hits</th><th>Proportion</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>rex.kb.dk</td><td>3531</td><td>33.1%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>www.kb.dk</td><td>1830</td><td>17.1%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>base.kb.dk</td><td>5301</td><td>49.7%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>total</td><td>10662</td><td>100%</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>Within this subset of our data, the OPAC has more
      successfully directed users to the resources than in the overall
      data set. Still, within this subset with, so to speak, equal
      opportunity, the web sites disseminates the resources much more
      effectively: 66.9% of the users came that way.</p>

      <p>We can, obviously, not tell from a web access log to what
      extent sheet music is printed and put on a note stand and
      actually performed. One usage of a URL which we can measure is
      to what extent other link to our resources. We got 23831 hits on
      this material from links on resources on other domains (see
      Table 3 for a summary of the domains of most important referring
      pages). Some of these services are harvesters (yahoo.com and
      google.com surely are). Among these external links, the hits
      coming from referring pages situated on specialized music
      portals of various kinds the most important source of traffic on
      our site.</p>

	other domains. The list contains links from sites contributing
	more than 50 hits and that are entirely unconnected to the

      <p>An interesting a question is how the remote services found
      the resources. Obviously we will never be able to answer that
      question. We can, however, count how many of the count on how
      many of 23831 belong to the resources that are disseminated via
      the web services or via the OPAC or via both services. This
      comparison can be found in Table 4.</p>

      <table border="1">
	<caption>Table 4. The number of hits on digital sheet music
	hyperlinked from remote resources categorized with respect to
	how the link is published on the kb.dk servers. This is a
	measure on how the authors of the remote documents originally
	found the resources.</caption>
	<tr>
	  <th>URL disseminated via</th>
	  <th>Number of hits to these URLs from remote resources
	  (referring page not in .kb.dk domain)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>www.kb.dk &amp; base.kb.dk</td>
	  <td>17501</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

      </table>

      <p>Finally, we know that bibliographic records are moving targets
      in many ways. One the ways is that records are exported from the
      OPAC to the national union catalogue <a
      href="http://bibliotek.dk">bibliotek.dk</a>. This has been
      raised as an important argument for cataloging digitized
      cultural heritage material in the OPAC, since (i) the union
      catalogue is much used and because (ii) it is collaborating with
      google.com.</p>

      <p>We can at least partly refute this argument for the following
      reasons: The search engines are minor actors in this area (cf.,
      Table 3). They are more important as disseminators of those of
      our web pages that link to the sheet music than disseminators of
      the digitized objects themselves. This is most likely due to the
      fact that these PDFs contain very little text to index. That is,
      the hits we get this way is more due to less than excellent
      preparation of our resources for harvesting, than successful
      export of data to google from bibliotek.dk.</p>

      <p>As regards the importance of bibliotek.dk as disseminator of
      our sheet music, we have have to draw a very dissapointing
      conclusion: We have recorded 9 (nine) hits on sheet music from
      the bibliotek.dk service within this dataset.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="lvl2">

      <h2>Summary &amp; Conclusions</h2>

      <p>To summarize all these data we can list the conclusions as
      follows. For users that came to our sheet music via servers in
      the kb.dk domain we draw the following conclusions:</p>

      <ul>

	<li>Only 950 files from the catalogue out of 3249 possible are
	actually used. We don't know sure why this is so, but most of
	these hits are within collections that are specifically
	promoted on the web site www.kb.dk.</li>

	<li>The approximately 40% of the objects disseminated via the
	web attracts about 80% of the hits on this material type.</li>

	<li>For the small subset of links that are disseminated via
	both the web and the OPAC, i.e., the area of equal opportunity
	adhered to above, the about 60% of the users came to the
	resource via the web.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As regards links from external resources, we can conclude
      that they come from all over the place, and in particular
      various specialized music portals. As expected, a resource
      disseminated via the web is more likely to attract external
      links than one promoted via the OPAC.</p>

      <p>Finally, there are extremely few hits from other OPACs. The
      only found this year are 9 (nine) hits from bibliotek.dk.</p>

      <p>I wouldn't claim that it is a disadvantage for libraries to
      use searchable databases for promoting its resources, but I have
      to conclude that it is close to suicidal to use them as the
      <strong>only</strong> access method to digital resources.</p>
