      <h2>1. The problem</h2>

      <p>What can deduced by analyses of the search terms entered into
      the search field on the home page of a large modern library?
      Could we possibly regard this form as the digital library´s
      information desk, and the queries as the request from its
      patrons? If we do that, what could we then learn about the
      quality of service?</p>

      <p>In this note we do just that. We regard the terms entered
      into the form as manifestation of our patrons needs and in order
      to find out <em>what they need</em>, we have performed a
      preliminary text mining exercise. We hope that this will help us
      designing a new search facility that will better answer the
      needs of our users.</p>

      <h2>2. The data</h2>

      <p>During the period from the end of May to the end of November
      2005 users performed 31729 searches in the search field on the
      Royal Library's home page<sup><a href="#htdig">1</a></sup>. A
      monthly overview can be found in Table 1.</p>

      <table width="50%">
	<caption>Table 1. Number of searches by month year 2005</caption>
	<tr><th>Month</th><th>Number of searches</th></tr>
	<tr><td>May</td><td>14</td></tr>
	<tr><td>June</td><td>3578</td></tr>

      </table>

      <p>The log files on KB's external web-server, <a
      href="http://www.kb.dk/">www.kb.dk</a> were text mined with
      respect to the URI of the full text search field on the KB top
      page. All terms were transformed to lower case in order to
      minimize the number of duplicates. There are still duplicates,
      since the procedure used could not distinguish between terms
      like "hc andersen" and "h.c. andersen". The frequencies for each
      term was calculated, and the data where then sorted with respect
      to that and transformed into a large table which can be found in
      the companion document (it is <em><strong>HUGE</strong></em>
      and may kill your browser) <a href="search-terms.html">All
      31729 searches</a>.</p>

      <p>The data set indicates that there are a few questions that
      are performed repeatedly. These are, however a fairly small
      fraction but could be labelled as <em>FAQ</em>s. For example,
      the ten most frequent FAQs where posed 1647 times. This amounts
      to roughly five percent of the grand total. The unique queries,
      and the ones that were repeated up to ten times constitutes
      13255 search events.</p>

      <p>The accumulated frequency of queries, from the unique ones
      (search terms that appear once in the log files) to the left to
      the FAQs to the right is depicted in Figure 1. There were 9023
      unique queries, while the all time high search term is
      <em>infomedia</em>. We will return to this term below.</p>

      <a href="distribution.pdf" ><img border="0" src="distribution.png" 
	   alt="The accumulated frequency of query repetitions"/></a>
      <blockquote>Figure 1. The accumulated frequency of query
      repetitions. For any value of the query repetition on the
      x-axis, the corresponding y-value is the number of queries with
      this or lower x-value.</blockquote>


      <p>The graph approaches asymptotically the grand total
      31729. The take home message of this statistical exercise is
      that if we concentrated on satisfying the users that posed the
      most common questions, we would leave a majority of our users
      out in the cold.</p>

      <p>The number of words entered into the search field was, on
      average, 1.8 which we assume is higher than average for search
      engines<sup><a href="#tbray">2</a></sup>. The distribution of
      query lengths can be seen in Figure 2. The unusually high number
      of search terms is can be understood by the facts that a person
      (e.g., an author) is best identified by a given name and a
      surname and that a book is best identified by its author and
      title. I.e., we may actually expect that library search engines
      are queried with about two search terms, since common searches
      call for at least two words.</p>

      <p>The mode of the query length distribution is at one word, and
      the median at about 16, so it is still extremely skewed</p>

	   alt="Distribution of the number of words entered."/></a>
      <blockquote>Figure 2. Distribution of the number of words
      entered into the search field. NB, the y-axis is using
      logarithmic scale.</blockquote>

      <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

      <p>Given that the engine covered the web only (i.e., not the
      catalogues, and only a subset of our own databases and not the
      licensed resources themselves), we may conclude that many of our
      users left the search engine quite frustrated. From the logs we
      cannot deduce just how frustrated, since unfortunately we do not
      know the success rate. From intuition and some tests with the
      current Google Box search engine, we can give a rule of thumb:
      The success rate is increasing with query repetition rate. The
      about one third of the query terms that are more or less unique
      have a high failure rate, whereas the success rate is extremely
      high for the common ones.</p>

      <p>What results did the users expect when entering terms into
      that search field?  A decent service would be one answer, but
      that will not help us. It is more useful to look at the terms,
      and ask the question: To which kind database would one
      preferably send each of the queries? Using that method, we may
      categorize the terms, try to guess the users intention and
      deduce requirements for our new search service.</p>

      <p>The method is somewhat arbitrary, and we have not had the
      time to categorize all 31729 queries. We give a list of query
      types below. To us they are fairly obvious when looking at the
      data. The estimated frequencies are based on a random sample of
      search terms (about 1% of the entire data-set). The frequencies
      are calculated on the number of terms, not queries. This means
      that the term <em>infomedia</em> was counted once, although it
      was repeatedly used as a query. Zero percent means that the
      category was too rare to appear in the sample.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>Electronic resources</strong> (8.5%) <p>The search term
	  <em>infomedia</em> refers most likely to the PolINFO/Infomedia
	  database. This is the most frequent term in the data set. It is
	  twice as common as the one on the second position. The term was
	  submitted on the average 2.7 times a day during the period. Clearly
	  users were looking for an electronic resource. Other similar search
	  terms are <em>portrætregistranten</em>, <em>lexis nexis</em>,
	  <em>grove music online, fjernadgang</em> and <em>jstor</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Individual journal articles</strong> (0%) <p><em> journal of
	  japanese studies vol. 3.2</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Work titles/Individual books</strong> (11%) <p>There are a
	  large number of searches like <em>den lille havfrue</em>, <em>den
	  grimme ælling</em>, <em>guaman poma</em>, <em>handbook of applied
	  cognition</em> etc.  If users expected a bibliographic search for
	  <em>romeo og julie</em> or a digitized version is hard to tell. Most
	  likely both.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Names of persons and organisations</strong> (35%)

	  <p><em>dostojevskij</em> is a clearly an author, and the user who
	  entered it was almost certainly expecting information on our
	  holdings. But did he or she want information on books by Fjodor or
	  about him? We will never know.</p> <p>It is not always obvious if a
	  search for a name was intended as a bibliographic search, or if it
	  was one for local resources. This is the case for names like <em>h c
	  andersen</em> and <em>kierkegaard</em>. We may, safely, assume that
	  users were expecting a bibliographic search for a number of the
	  names find in the logs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Subject searches</strong> (24%) <p>Subject terms are very
	  common; they are terms like <em>psykologi</em>, <em>girafsprog</em>,
	  <em>20th century music</em> and <em>middelalder</em>.</p> <p>Subject
	  searches are difficult to evaluate. The user, who obviously has a
	  need to get information on something, honors us with a click in
	  order to do something about it. They expect possibly information
	  categorized by subject descriptors. These users might have wished
	  full-text search capabilities in journal articles or even in
	  encyclopedias.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Integers or decimal numbers</strong> (0%) <p>Most of
	  these are obviously years, <em>1945</em>. I.e., they could
	  be seen as subjects.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Media types/genres</strong> (6%)
	  <p><em>harmonika - orkesternoder</em>, <em>foto</em>,
	  <em>rusland billeder</em>, <em>folk songs</em>, <em>1
	  instrument og 1 sangstemme</em>, <em>romaner</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Obvious full text queries</strong> (0%) <p>Verbatim
	  quotations from literary works, poems or even song texts
	  appear now and then: <em>once upon a time there was a
	  prince</em> is the incipit of "The Princess and the Pea"</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Collections</strong> (3%) <p>Terms like
	  <em>bibliotheca danica</em>, <em>portrætsamlingen</em>,
	  <em>aviser</em>, belong to this category. The last of these
	  could also be a synonym for <em>infomedia</em>. This is a
	  heterogenous category. Some of the searchers
	  obviously know that there exists a collection called
	  <em>bibliotecha danica</em>. However, you may just take for
	  granted that there exists a collection of <em>aviser</em>, i.e.
	  newspapers, at a National Library.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Library staff and departments</strong> (3%)
	  <p>Some personal names are easily recognized as belonging to
	  members of staff. <em>erland kolding</em>, <em>birgit
	  henriksen</em>, <em>michael cotta-schønberg</em> and
	  <em>sigfrid lundberg</em> ;-) belong to this category.</p>
	  <p>Departments within the library are popular targets:
	  <em>håndskriftafdelingen</em>, <em>fiolstræde</em>
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Information about the Royal Library</strong> (8%)
	  <p><em>åbningstide</em>, <em>bevaring</em>, <em>ledige stillinger</em>,
	  <em>historien om det kongelige bibliotek</em>, <em>blixen -
	  conference room</em> and <em>årsberetning</em> belong
	  here.</p>

	<h3>4.1. Names, subjects and titles</h3>

	<p>Names, a majority of them personal and a small fraction
	corporate ones, was the single largest category of search
	terms. More than one third (35%) of the terms did belong to
	this category. About one quarter of the terms were subjects
	(24%). Finally about one tenth of them (11%) where for
	specific titles. Some of these included both author and
	title.</p>

	<p>Searches for names and titles give hits in various places
	in our web site, notably in archived lists of new acquisition,
	but also (if the searcher is really lucky) in digital texts.</p>

	<p>For broad subject searches, like <em>fysik</em> (physics)
	there is a fair chance that the user finds an entry in the
	subject based collections of electronic resources. For narrow
	terms, eg, <em>Inkaer</em> (inka indians) there are no way
	out.</p>

	<p>This search engine was only capable to search in the texts
	available (this is true for the Google box as well). There is
	no way to tell users "Mona Lisa, see Leonardo da Vinci".</p>

      </div>

      <div id="electronicresources" class="level3">

	<h3>4.2. Electronic resources, collections, mediatypes and genres</h3>

	<p>The names, titles and subject searches may to some extent
	be regarded as bibliographic. Some users may have opted for a
	web search rather than a bibliographic in the catalogue in
	the hope to get digital content. Some search terms, like
	<em>infomedia</em> are obviously intended as searches for
	electronic resources. The search terms in this category have
	high repetition rate, which shows that they are issued by
	quite experienced users of the library.</p>

	<p>The distinction between our categories Collections and
	Electronic Resources are a bit arbitarary, and to some extent
	this is true for the Mediatypes as well.</p>

	<p>The Electronic Resources are a mixture of licensed material
	and local resources. For inexperinced users it is essential
	that there are good collection level descriptions <sup><a
	href="#collectionlevel">3</a></sup> which together with
	subject based information guides may serve as aggregating
	entry points for all kinds of resources accessable via the
	library.</p>

      </div>

      <div id="searchweb" class="level3">

	<h3>4.3. <em>"Search on KB's web (but NOT in REX)"</em></h3>

	<p>Over the search form we are investigating there is a text
	stating: <em>Search on KB's web (but NOT in REX)</em>. One may
	argue that some of our users have misunderstood the function of
	this input field.</p>

	<p>However, one may just as well argue that our search field
	does not take into account the requirements of our users and
	that a large library should be able to provide answers to all
	these kinds queries using a simple search on its homepage.</p>
