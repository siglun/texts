      <h1>An attempt to implement editing of EAD using OOo</h1>

      <p>OpenOffice.org Writer is a word processor which is based on XML
	technologies. Furthermore, it is able to read and write other XML
	formats than its native using export and import filters written in XSLT.
	This package implements editing of EAD in OOo using that mechanism.</p>

      <h2>Please note that this is work in progress</h2>

      <p><strong>Don't expect</strong> this to work at all! The EAD produced
	isn't valid, and don't ever edit any originals using this. The EAD
	header is currently fake...</p>

      <h2>How to install</h2>

      <p>It is based on earlier efforts, and is used and installed the same way
	as the DocBook filter
	(cf., <a
	  href="http://xml.openoffice.org/xmerge/docbook/">
	  http://xml.openoffice.org/xmerge/docbook/</a>)
	and the very similar TEI filter
	(cf., <a
	  href="http://www.tei-c.org/Software/teioo/">http://www.tei-c.org/Software/teioo/</a>)
	It is based on both of these packages.</p>

      <p>To run it you'll need the following (all of it is packaged in a
	zip-archive, see below):</p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="did_and_c_and_archdesc.xsl">did_and_c_and_archdesc.xsl</a></li>
	<li><a href="ead-to-oo.xsl">ead-to-oo.xsl</a></li>
	<li><a href="ead2002.stw">ead2002.stw</a></li>
	<li><a href="oo-to-ead.xsl">oo-to-ead.xsl</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first of these files is automatically generated by transform
	<a href="table-lables.xml">table-lables.xml</a> using <a
	  href="generate-stylesheet.xsl">generate-stylesheet.xsl</a>. The whole
	package are in <a href="the_package.zip">the_package.zip</a>, which is
	usually the most recent version that actually works ;-)</p>
