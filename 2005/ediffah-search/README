This is what I use for searching the Ediffah database.[1] It is a
collection of php scripts.[2] To run them you need the yaz library
from indexdata.[3]

The included files are as follows

advanced.php		A first shot at an advanced search interface
arkiv_ex-hit.xsl	A XSLT script for formatting hits
forms_and_searching.php	Functions for generating forms and other stuff
fragments.php		HTML fragments (for generating the pages)
globals.php		Global parameters
index.php		the top page
search.php		The script that presents the hits
present.cgi		A perl script presenting the detailed records

Every thing here is provided as is. And mind you, everything that's
free comes with no guarantee :)

The tar.gz includes only the client software and represents the first
version of this service; the current version is improved but cannot be
distributed since it contain information that would compromise the
security of the service.

The actual search engine is idZebra[4], also from indexdata.

In this case there is no manual, since this is not really a software
distribution. It's merely an example of how one can easily search a
collection of EAD records.
