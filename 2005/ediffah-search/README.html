    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>The name Ediffah is an acronym of the Swedish name of a project aiming
      at providing an infrastructure for cataloging and searching archival collections at
      Swedish research libraries</p>

    <p>The infrastructure includes components for</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>EAD Authoring.</strong> Most partners are currently using
	Note Tab Pro</li>

      <li><strong>Publishing system.</strong> We use a simple web based interface
	permitting catalogers to upload EAD finding aids to a database. The
	database is a file system based data store supporting the following
	operations:
	<ul>
	  <li><em>Insert</em></li>
	  <li><em</emRemove>Remove</em></li>
	  <li><em>Update</em> (implemented as a remove+insert while maintaining record
	    ID)</li> 
	  <li><em>Hide</em>, which makes a finding aid invisible to end users while
	    still accessible and searchable for editorial staff.</li>
	  <li><em>Publish</em>, which makes a previously hidden finding-aid visible for
	    end users.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>An <strong>indexing system</strong> whereby inserted finding aids are
	mead searchable in two databases, one containg the public ones and the
	other those that are hidden. The publishing and indexing system
	communicates through a simple printer queue like communication systems.
	The publishing system thus spools incremental requests for either
	removal or insertion of finding aids into the index. Since each job
	submitted to the indexer is very small, the queue is flushed once a minute.</li>

      <li>A <strong>search system</strong> permitting end users and client
	systems search the database. This system comprises two components
	<ul>
	  <li>A server system</li>
	  <li>A web based client or gateway</li>
	</ul>
	Currently the client and server communicates through Z39.50 using XML
	record syntax.
      </li>

    </ol>

    
    <h2>Software used</h2>
    
    <p>Very little software has been written for implementing Ediffah.  The
      whole system consists of about 900 lines object oriented perl libraries
      implementing the abstractions behind the file store and user
      interfaces. These lines are used in another about 500 lines of scripts
      implementing the publishing and indexing systems and the communication
      protocol between the two. Finally the end user interface, the
      client/gateway, consists of about 900 lines of php code originally
      written for other purposes.</p>

    <p>The bulk of the system is open source software readily available on the
      Internet and the whole system will run on a simple PC under Linux.</p>


    <h3>The client</h3>

    <p>This is what I use for searching the Ediffah database.[1] It is a
      collection of php scripts.[2] To run them you need the yaz library
      from indexdata.[3]</p>

    <p>The included files are as follows</p>
    <pre>
      advanced.php		A first shot at an advanced search interface
      arkiv_ex-hit.xsl	        A XSLT script for formatting hits
      forms_and_searching.php	Functions for generating forms and other stuff
      fragments.php		HTML fragments (for generating the pages)
      globals.php		Global parameters
      index.php		        the top page
      search.php		The script that presents the hits
      present.cgi		A perl script presenting the detailed records
    </pre>

    <p>The code above is included in <a href="./ediffah_gate.tar.gz">
	ediffah_gate.tar.gz</a> Every thing here is provided as is. And mind
      you, everything that's 
      free comes with no guarantee :),
      using that you would presumably be able to search Ediffah from your own
      web server. However, there is no manual, since this is not really a
      software distribution. It's merely an example of how one can easily
      search a collection of EAD records.</p>

    <p>The tar.gz includes only the client software and represents the first
      version of this service; the current version is improved but cannot be
      distributed since it contain information that would compromise the
      security of the service. So would a distribution of the current
      publishing system.</p>

    <h2>The search engine and indexing principles</h2>

    <p>The actual search engine is idZebra[4], also from indexdata.
      To understand exactly how the server is used requires some knowledge on
      the principles of Z39.50. Elsewhere I have described in some detail the
      principles I used for building a similar service, namely <em>St
	Laurentius Digital Manuscript Library</em> [5,6]. Please note that
      things has changed significantly since that system was implemented. The
      most important differences being that XML has become a common record
      syntax in the Z39.50 community and that idZebra thus has evolved
      significantly to support that. It now has a good support for connecting
      XML constructs to Z39.50 search attributes via the XML Path
      language.[7]</p>

    <p>The powerful feature of idZebra to permit configuring search attributes
      to contain sets of search attributes which I describe in [6] is also used
      extensively in the Ediffah search engine. The configuration files used
      are in the syntax described in [8]. For those technically minded, the <a
	href="http://sigge.lub.lu.se/2004/ediffah/idzebra/tabs/ead.abs">ead.abs</a> 
      file, defining how EAD tags and XML constructs are tied to the indexes and
      search attributes are available for inspection, and so is the extended
      subset of the BIB-1 attribute set we are using <a
	href="http://sigge.lub.lu.se/2004/ediffah/idzebra/tabs/bib1.att">bib1.att</a>
    </p>
