  <abstract>
    <para>This document specifies the metadata used in the Lund university
      dissertation database.</para>
  </abstract>


  <sect1>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The current Dissertation abstract service
      <footnoteref linkend="DISSDB" /> at
      Lund university is based on free text search on a weakly fielded
      record model. By that statement I understand that it is possible to
      identify where in the HTML document used as the record syntax
      information of given type is found. It is thus possible to generate
      these records by HTML forms, and also to edit the metadata through
      this procedure.</para>

    <para>Although the database could be said to be "fielded", it is impossible
      to search it that way. Also, the collection of records are in state of
      decay; the data has been created with different tools, under
      different operating systems with different character encodings. This,
      in turn, means that recall as well as precision has been suffering.</para>

    <para>During the autumn 2001, a new prototype user interface with
      enhanced search system <footnoteref linkend="PROTOTYPE" /> (please note
      that the search system might not be operatational at all times).
      The work included an
      export facility, making it possible recover a fairly large proportion
      of the legacy database. The content model of the prototype service was
      documented using a XML dtd <footnoteref linkend="not3" />.
      This paper is the
      result of the discussions that followed, and articulates the
      modifications that we have made on the metadata to satisfy the
      functional requirements of the long overdue service. Further
      documentation exists in the form of a revised DTD
      <footnoteref linkend="not7" /> and a manually
      prepared record implementing
      it <footnoteref linkend="not8" /></para>

    <para>This is not an academic exercise, since the data model of a
      service is something we have to live with in this service, and also
      something we will have to explain to users, and also something we will
      have to pay for in terms of human labour.</para>

    <title>On Dissertations</title>

    <para>A dissertation is a publication, and the basis for my model is
      basically a bibliographic record. However, it is in several ways more
      detailed, since a dissertation is connected to an event, the defense
      act. The defense act is an event which occurs at certain place and at
      a certain time, and it involves a special person, the external
      examiner employed by the faculty.</para>

    <para>A dissertation may be a traditional monograph, but more often than
      not, a dissertation is a composite document. In this case it consists
      of an abstract, a summary which in itself is a sizable document, and a
      number of articles.</para>

    <para>Considerations as those above gave me the following elements (this is
      not a complete list, since I have omitted some that are used
      internally, auto-generated, or are of less importance).</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title>The Content Model</title>

    <para>The top element of the DTD is 'dissertation'. The element has two
      attributes 'status' and fulltext (with values from the enumerated
      list: submitted, issued and failed) (accepting the values 'public',
      'archived' and 'missing').</para>

    <para>The lists below show the exact order in which the elements must occur
      in order to be valid according to the DTD. An element followed by '?'
      are optional or may occur exactly once, whereas if an element is
      followed by '*', the element may be included zero or more times. '|'
      implies a choice. For instance you may have either an arbitrary number
      of 'component-journal-article' or zero or one single
      'component-blob'.</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	creator,
	supervisor,
	title,
	pages,
	language,
	availability,
	date-issued,
	defended,
	uncontrolled-terms?,
	controlled-terms?,
	controlled-umi-term,
	summary-in-english,
	summary-in-swedish?,
	funded-by*,
	component-blob?|
		(component-journal-article*|
		component-article-in-book*|
		component-report*|
		component-eprint*)
	rights-management
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title>Detailed description of bibliographic elements</title>

    <para>A creator is a person. In Scripta, a person has the following
      characteristics:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	name,
	born?,
	electronic-address?,
	affiliation?
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>The meaning characteristics should be obvious. Date of birth is
      available and is widely used in bibliographic records. One may
      question if date of admittance to a post-graduate program is relevant,
      and the same is true for gender. 'address' is the electronic one. name
      has a content model of itself:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	#PCDATA|(last,first)
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>that is, you may either enter a string or surname and given
      name. Affiliation is an organization, or possibly a division within an
      organization. Organizations are described as</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	name?,
	(name-hierarchy|department)?,
	home-page?,
	postal-address?     
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>I.e., the record contains either a name-hierarchy or a
      department. Name hierarchy is of the form "faculty / department /
      sub-department" and applies to affiliations within Lund university. It
      will permit search for the exact match or sub-string, i.e., give me
      all dissertations within the faculty of science or give me all
      dissertations in Limnology (search for string and switch on
      complete field).</para>

    <para>The availability element follows the GILS Z39.50
      protocol <footnoteref linkend="not4"/> and is structured into the
      following:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	available,
	medium,
	distributor
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>'medium' is the SAFARI document type of the thesis, i.e.,
      text.thesis.doctoral. A distributor is an organization and described
      as for affiliation above.</para>

    <para>Available has the following content model:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	linkage?,
	issn?,
	series-title?,
	isbn?,
	coden?
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>The linkage is the URL of the thesis cover page in our archive, if
      available from that source.  The structuring of availability is
      dependent on the GILS tag-set <footnoteref linkend="not4" />.</para>

    <para>The 'defended' element is unique to dissertations:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	date,
	time,
	location,
	external-examiner
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>I.e., when, where and who does the dirty job. opponent is a person,
      and has thus the same content model as creator.</para>

    <para>The dissertations are indexed using uncontrolled-terms and
      controlled-terms. Each of these may include an arbitrary number of
      uterm and cterm respectively. The current prototype database is using
      CERIF as the controlled subject vocabulary
      <footnoteref linkend="not5" />
      (available in the tree format <footnoteref linkend="not6" />.
      The version of CERIF has some shortcomings as regards its structure,
      and its worst is medicine.</para>

    <para>In addition to CERIF, we also need a UMI subject
      <footnoteref linkend="not9"/><footnoteref linkend="not10"/>,
      in order to export data to UMI's database.
      This subject is stored in the element 'controlled-umi-term',
      which is mandatory and not repeatable.</para>

    <para>The funded-by element names the sponsoring organisation(s) and is
      repeatable. Like affiliation and distributor,
      it is an organisation.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title>Detailed description of descriptive elements</title>

    <para>A valid dissertation description must contain a
      summary-in-english and may include a summary-in-swedish.
      It has been regarded as a functional requirement that these
      should be give a minimum of typographical adornment.
      The DTD defines a typographic content model containing the
      following tags for this purpose:</para>

    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>

	ol|
	ul|
	p|
	sub|
	sup|
	strong|
	em
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>They are borrowed directly from HTML and means ordered list,
      un-ordered list, paragraph, sub-script super-script, bold and
      emphasis, respectively. The tag 'li', list item, may be used in both
      list types.</para>

    <para>The typographic content model applies to 'title' and
      'cross-reference-blob' as well, the former that I felt that our
      database already contain titles with super- and sub-scripts. Also,
      emphasis is used for species names in paleontology, biology and
      medicine. Actually, contrary to the DTD, the database contain quite a
      few records that use emphasis on the uncontrolled terms for species
      names. (All records are well-formed XML,
      only a minority are valid).</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title>Detailed description of descriptive elements</title>

    <para>The content model permits two forms of cross-references, or component
      publications. The way this concept has been introduced into the DTD is
      borrowed directly from GILS[4], but it is subject to revision.  The
      cross-reference-blob is the home for legacy cross references, there is
      no way one can correct their format automatically.</para>

    <para>The dissertations components are expected to be of three kinds
      article in book, journal article and reports, where the latter are
      expected to contain publications of various shades of grey. Patents
      goes into this category as well. These three correspond to the
      following three elements: component-journal-article,
      component-article-in-book, component-report and component-eprint.  All
      of these elements have the following common substructure in
      common:</para>


    <para>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
      creator+,
      date?,
      title,
      appeared-in-title?,
      volume?,
      issue?,
      pages?,
      isbn?,
      issn?,
      coden?,
      editor*,
      part-of-series-title?,
      publisher*,
      locator*
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>



    <para>Where the semantics of the elements are defined as follows.</para>

    <table>
      <title>Semantics of component metadata</title>
      <tgroup cols="2">
	<tbody>
      <row><entry>creator</entry>
	<entry>The name of an author. A person as for the other
	  persons</entry></row>

      <row><entry>book-title</entry>
	<entry>For an article that is part of a book, the title of
	  the book</entry></row>

      <row><entry>place-published</entry>
	<entry>The place of publication of a book.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>date</entry>
	<entry>The date of publication, yyyy.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>editor</entry>
	<entry>For an article that is part of a book, the name  of
	  an editor of the book.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>publisher</entry>
	<entry>The publisher of a book or report series.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>appeared-in-title</entry>
	<entry>For articles, the title of the journal or book
	  the work appeared in.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>issue</entry>
	<entry>The number of the journal issue (or, if
	  applicable, of the report itself.</entry></row>
                                                   
      <row><entry>volume</entry><entry>Journal volume number.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>part-of-series-title</entry>
	<entry>In case of an article or a report,
	  the name of the  book or report.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>title</entry>
	<entry>The name of the component work. Typically a
	  title of an article.</entry></row>

      <row><entry>locator</entry>
	<entry>For any component medium a pointer to an electronic version
	  of the object.</entry></row>
	</tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para>Each of these elements accepts the attribute status taking either
      of the values 'manuscript', 'submitted', 'inpress' and
      'published'.</para>

    <para>Finally, the DTD includes an element 'rights-management',
      meant to be presented as an acknowledgment to a publisher.</para>
