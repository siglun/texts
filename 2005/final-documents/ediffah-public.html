    <h1 class="level1">Introduction</h1>

    <p>The name Ediffah is an acronym of the Swedish name (<em>Ediffah --
	En digital infrastruktur f√∂r forskningsbibliotekens arkiv- och
	handskriftssamlingar</em>) of a project aiming at providing an
      infrastructure for cataloging and searching archival collections at 
      Swedish research libraries</p>

    <p>The infrastructure includes components for</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<em>EAD Authoring.</em> Most partners are currently using
	Note Tab Pro</li>

      <li>
	
	  <em>Publishing system.</em> We use a simple web based interface
	  permitting catalogers to upload EAD finding aids to a database. The
	  database is a file system based data store supporting the following
	  operations:
	  <ul>
	  <li><em>Insert</em></li>
	  <li><em>Remove</em></li>
	  <li>
	      <em>Update</em> 
		(implemented as a remove+insert while maintaining record
		ID)
	    </li> 
	    <li>
	      <em>Hide</em>, which makes a finding aid
		invisible to end users while still accessible and searchable
		for editorial staff.</li> 
	    <li><em>Publish</em>, which makes a
		previously hidden finding-aid visible for end users.
	    </li> 
	  </ul>
	
      </li>

      <li>
	An <em>indexing system</em> whereby inserted finding aids are
	  mead searchable in two databases, one containg the public ones and the
	  other those that are hidden. The publishing and indexing system
	  communicates through a simple printer queue like communication systems.
	  The publishing system thus spools incremental requests for either
	  removal or insertion of finding aids into the index. Since each job
	  submitted to the indexer is very small, the queue is flushed once a
	  minute.
      </li>

      <li>
	A <em>search system</em> permitting end users and client
	  systems search the database. This system comprises two components
	  <ul>
	    <li>A server system</li>
	    <li>A web based client or gateway</li>
	  </ul>
	  Currently the client and server communicates through Z39.50 using XML
	  record syntax.
	
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div><div class="level1" id="software">
    
    <h1 class="level1">Software used</h1>
    
    <p>Very little software has been written for implementing Ediffah.  The
      whole system consists of about 900 lines object oriented perl libraries
      implementing the abstractions behind the file store and user
      interfaces. These lines are used in another about 500 lines of scripts
      implementing the publishing and indexing systems and the communication
      protocol between the two. Finally the end user interface, the
      client/gateway, consists of about 900 lines of php code originally
      written for other purposes.</p>

    <p>The bulk of the system is open source software readily available on the
      Internet and the whole system will run on a simple PC under Linux.</p>

    <div class="level2" id="client">
      <h2 class="level2">The client</h2>

      <p>This is what I use for searching the Ediffah database.
	<sup><a href="#ediffah-project">1</a></sup> It is a 
	collection of php scripts.<sup><a href="#php">2</a></sup> To run them you
	need the yaz library from indexdata.<sup><a href="#yaz">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>The included files are as follows</p>
      <table>
	<caption>Scripts in the client</caption>
	
	  <tr><td>advanced.php</td><td>A first shot at an advanced search interface</td></tr><tr><td>ediffaht-hit.xsl</td><td>A XSLT script for formatting hits</td></tr><tr><td>forms_and_searching.php</td><td>Functions for generating forms and other stuff</td></tr><tr><td>fragments.php</td><td>HTML fragments (for generating the pages)</td></tr><tr><td>globals.php</td><td>Global parameters</td></tr><tr><td>index.php</td><td>the top page</td></tr><tr><td>search.php</td><td>The script that presents the hits</td></tr><tr><td>present.cgi</td><td>A perl script presenting the detailed records</td></tr>
	
      </table>


      <p>The code above is included in <a href="http://www.ediffah.org/download/ediffah_gate.tar.gz">ediffah_gate.tar.gz</a>
	Every thing in there is provided as is. And mind you, everything that's
	free comes with no guarantee :), using that you would presumably be
	able to search Ediffah from your own web server. However, there is no
	manual, since this is not really a software distribution. It's merely
	an example of how one can easily search a collection of EAD records.</p>

      <p>The tar.gz includes only the client software and represents the first
	version of this service; the current version is improved but cannot be
	distributed since it contain information that would compromise the
	security of the service. So would a distribution of the current
	publishing system.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="level2" id="searchengine">
    
      <h2 class="level2">The search engine and indexing principles</h2>

      <p>The actual search engine is idZebra,<sup><a href="#zebra">4</a></sup>
	also from indexdata. To understand exactly how the server is used
	requires some knowledge on the principles of Z39.50. Elsewhere I have
	described in some detail the principles I used for building a similar
	service, namely <em>St Laurentius Digital Manuscript
	  Library</em><sup><a href="#laurentius">5</a></sup><sup><a href="#excursion">6</a></sup>. Please note that things has changed
	significantly since that system was implemented. The most important
	differences being that XML has become a common record  syntax in the
	Z39.50 community and that idZebra thus has evolved significantly to
	support that. It now has a good support for connecting XML constructs
	to Z39.50 search attributes via the XML Path language.<sup><a href="#xpath">7</a></sup> 
      </p>

      <p>The powerful feature of idZebra to permit configuring search attributes
	to contain sets of search attributes which I describe in [6] is also used
	extensively in the Ediffah search engine. The configuration files used
	are in the syntax described in the <em>Zebra
	  manual</em><sup><a href="#zebra_manual">8</a></sup>. For those
	technically minded, the <a href="http://www.ediffah.org/idzebra/tabs/ead.abs">ead.abs</a>
	file, defining how EAD tags and XML constructs are tied to the indexes and
	search attributes are available for inspection, and so is the extended
	subset of the BIB-1 attribute set we are using <a href="http://www.ediffah.org/idzebra/tabs/bib1.att">bib1.att</a> 
      </p>

    <div class="level2" id="filestore">
      <h2 class="level2">The Ediffah file store and the Ediffah identifier</h2>

      <p>Each finding aid in Ediffah is uniquely identified by its
	identifier. It has the following syntax (in EBNF<sup><a href="#EBNF">9</a></sup>):</p> 

      <pre>
identifier ::= network ':' owner ':' part1 ':' part2

network    ::= [a-z]+
/* In Ediffah, the network is, of course always ediffah */

owner      ::= [a-z]+

part1      ::= [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
/* I.e., six digits */

part2      ::= [x0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
/* I.e., either a x followed by nine digits, or ten digits */
      </pre>
      
      <p>For example, a record from the ediffah network, owned by the GUBK
	partner may have the following identifier:</p>

      <pre>
ediffah:gubk:983039:x000010477
      </pre>

      <p>There is a direct mapping between the identifier and the directory
	in the service. The part1 digits are split into three groups of two
	digits, and they form a sequence of directories. The colon between
	part1 and part2 are replaced with a dash and form the name of a fourth
	directory level. All files are have the same name, finding-aid. The
	file suffix are as follows:</p>

      <table>
	<caption>File suffixes</caption>
	
	  <tr><td>ead</td><td>A visible file</td></tr><tr><td>eadi</td><td>A hidden file</td></tr><tr><td>eadd</td><td>A deleted file</td></tr>
	
      </table>

      <p>Hence a visible record with the identifier mentioned above will
	reside in:</p>

      <pre>
98/30/39/983039-x000010477/finding-aid.ead
      </pre>

      <p>Please not that the Ediffah identifier is not meant as a standard;
	it just a way of administrating the content of the Ediffah archival
	network.</p> 

    </div>

    <div class="level2" id="oaidataprovider">
      <h2 class="level2">OAI data provider</h2>
      <p>
	The Ediffah OAI services, see <a href="http://www.ediffah.org/oai">http://www.ediffah.org/oai</a>

      <div class="level3" id="oaiidentifiers">
