  <p>My name is Sigfrid Lundberg. The stuff I publish here may, or may not, be
  of interest for anyone else.</p>

  <p>On this site there is material on photography, music, literature and
  other stuff I enjoy in life. However, most of it is related to my profession
  as an Internet programmer and software developer within the area of digital
  libraries at the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/">Royal Library, Copenhagen</a>
  (Denmark) and, before that, Lund university (Sweden).</p>

  <p>The content here does not reflect the views of my past or present
  employers</p>
